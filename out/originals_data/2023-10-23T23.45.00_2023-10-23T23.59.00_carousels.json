                "en_content": "\u201cEconomic immigration to Switzerland has a major influence on which languages are spoken,\u201d says Renata Coray of the Institute of Multilingualism at the University of Fribourg.\nSwitzerland has \n: German (spoken by about 63% of the population), French (23%), Italian (8%) and Romansh (0.5%). Romansh is not an official language (apart from in canton Graub\u00fcnden). There has been a slight increase in French and English and a slight decrease in German in recent years.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nWhile French is spoken more and more, fewer and fewer Swiss speak German regularly. The main reason for this is migration. \nThis does not mean all Swiss are constantly flipping between several languages, although most of them regularly use more than one language either at home or at work. A government study from 2014 looked at Swiss aged 15 or more and found that the people most likely to use more than one language on a regular basis were those with a university education (76%), those aged 15-24 (79%) and those with jobs (72%). In addition, 84% of immigrants and their descendants were multilingual.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nAlmost two-thirds (64%) of Swiss use more than one language at least once a week, with 38% using two, 19% three and 7% four or more. \nA politically sensitive topic is when to start teaching English to Swiss schoolchildren. Many pupils and parents prefer English to be taught before another national language, arguing English is more useful. Others worry about the effects this could have on national cohesion.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nMore and more Swiss pupils are signing up for a bilingual education. \nWhatever happens in schools, more and more English is heard in Switzerland, owing not only to growing immigration from Anglophone countries but also because it is increasingly being used as a bridge between Swiss people from different linguistic regions. English is even creeping into German.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re never far from an English word in Switzerland. A linguist explains why \u2013 and whether there will be a backlash. \nAnd English is far from the only non-national language heard in Switzerland, with Portuguese and Albanian not far behind. Is migration responsible for the drop in the proportion of people who speak national languages as their first language? Yes and no.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe number of residents who do not speak any of the official Swiss languages as a main language has more than doubled this century. \nOne obvious area where misunderstandings could have serious consequences is politics. So how do the authorities ensure that parliamentarians are on the same page and know what they\u2019re voting for? In the House or Representatives (where German speakers must give speeches in High German) the answer is simultaneous interpreting.\n\u201cI was absolutely nervous the first time I did it!\u201d explains Hans Martin J\u00f6rimann, who has been interpreting in parliament for 14 years. \u201cI was overwhelmed not so much by the speeches that were delivered but by the context and all the specific jargon. Once you understand the way it works, it\u2019s a lot easier.\u201d\nMore\n\n\n\n\nEnsuring Swiss politicians can understand each other is challenging, stressful but rewarding, says one of parliament\u2019s official interpreters. \nArticles in this story\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

But what foreign students really like are PhDs: they made up 57% of doctoral entrants in 2020/2021. This compares to an average of 25%\u00a0across\u00a0OECD countries.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0OECD\u2019s\u00a0Education\u00a0at a Glance\u00a02019\u00a0report\u00a0on Switzerland explains\u00a0why Swiss doctorates are so attractive: above-average spending on research and development, which \u201cin turn support the progress of doctoral students both during and after their study\u201d,\u00a0and\u00a0low tuition fees.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor example,\u00a0the\u00a02021/22\u00a0tuition\u00a0fee\u00a0at the top-ranked Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich)\u00a0is around\u00a0CHF1,500\u00a0($1,546) for all students (Swiss and non-Swiss, the university makes no distinction)\u00a0compared\u00a0with\u00a0an average $50,000+ annual tuition fees for foreign students for many top US universities.\u00a0(Although academic fees are low, the cost of living in Switzerland is not.)\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe US and UK are the top destinations for international students. Relatively low tuition fees could help Switzerland compete for the top brains. \nThe fact that Switzerland\u00a0doctoral students are employed\u00a0by the universities\u00a0and earn a wage, which reduces their financial burden,\u00a0is another factor,\u00a0the OECD says.\u00a0\u00a0\nForeign students\u2019\u00a0study\u00a0subjects of choice? Natural\u00a0sciences\u00a0and engineering.\u00a0\n\u201cStorming the ivory tower requires patience, confidence and a little help from someone who has already done it,\u201d according to\u00a0Arasan\u00a0MJ,\u00a0one of our Indian student bloggers,\u00a0who studied\u00a0for a\u00a0masters in finance\u00a0at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.\u00a0\nIn his case, speaking to someone in charge of the course before sending in an application was very useful as it helped gauge his admission chances.\u00a0\nSwiss admission requirements are relatively straightforward, but there can be a lot of\u00a0extra documents, such as a course transcript and personal essay, to submit as well.\nOne accepted, those\u00a0applying from\u00a0outside of most of Europe\u00a0also\u00a0need\u00a0to apply for\u00a0a visa and\u00a0then, once in Switzerland,\u00a0a residence permit from the canton\u00a0of residence.\u00a0\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, foreign students from EU/EFTA countries have been allowed into Switzerland, subject to the normal immigration rules and quarantine rules if necessary.\u00a0\nForeign students from third countries can be admitted for education and training courses that last for more than 90 days, provided they meet the\u00a0\n. More information \nAdditionally,\u00a0applicants\u00a0often\u00a0need to\u00a0prove\u00a0a good grasp of the\u00a0language\u00a0of instruction, be that\u00a0German, French or Italian.\u00a0For\u00a0a growing number of\u00a0graduate\u00a0progammes,\u00a0the language of instruction is English.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nShould you start planning your university admission strategy two years in advance? The process can be complicated for international students. \nOnce in, foreign students can\u00a0generally\u00a0expect\u00a0broad\u00a0support for settling into their university of choice, as well as for academic and future work issues,\u00a0our reporting over the last years and\u00a0our bloggers\u00a0suggest.\u00a0Help has been available for international students during the pandemic, with student organisations such as the Erasmus Student Network Switzerland stepping in with admin and settling-in support\u00a0where there are gaps.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nCan Swiss universities offer the kind of support and vibrant student life that attracts many to the US and UK? \nAccording to\u00a0Gaurav Singh,\u00a0another\u00a0one\u00a0of our\u00a0Indian student bloggers, academic life in Switzerland can be quite different to\u00a0life\u00a0back home, as he reported in a post before the pandemic. He appreciated the emphasis on the practical\u00a0\u2013\u00a0rather than the theoretical\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in his\u00a0masters\u00a0course\u00a0at the University of Neuch\u00e2tel, which was designed to prepare him for the job market.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut he was surprised at students calling their professors by their first name.\u00a0\u201cSeveral times my professors had drinks with us in\u00a0ap\u00e9ros\u00a0organised by university. It was so different from India, where you have to say either refer to your lecturer as \u201cSir\u201d or \u201cProfessor\u201d to your teacher.

                "en_content": "Famous figures who have gone through the system include the former CEO of Switzerland\u2019s largest bank UBS, Sergio Ermotti and two current government ministers: Economics Minister Guy Parmelin, who did an agricultural apprenticeship, and Finance Minister Ueli Maurer, started out as a commercial clerk at a farming cooperative.\n\"It was good for me to go out working at such a young age. During that time I acquired skills and reflexes which have served me well throughout my career and which I still find useful on a daily basis,\u201d \n in an interview with the House of Switzerland.\nSwitzerland\u2019s dual system combines learning on the job \u2013 and being paid a learning wage \u2013 with one to two days of theory at school. Around two thirds of Swiss pupils opt for an apprenticeship.\n\n\n\n\nPupils face an important choice at the end of compulsory: apprenticeships or high school. \nAnd there are 230 vocational professions to choose from, ranging from catering to high-tech industries.\u00a0\nVocational and educational training (VET) is considered one\u00a0of Switzerland\u2019s economic success\u00a0factors, as it produces a well-qualified workforce and a relatively low youth unemployment rate \nAt the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, however, there were concerns that young people would struggle to find training places. Companies were tightening their belts and the 2020 spring shutdown made it harder for pupils to attend interviews and work placements, two essential components in securing apprenticeships.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nConcerns raised that the Covid-19 pandemic is affecting apprenticeships in Switzerland. \nThese fears were largely unfounded. \u201cOverall, VET has proven to be crisis-resistant during the Corona period,\u201d concluded a \n, issued to mark the closing down of a special government Covid-19 apprenticeship task force.\nBut as shown by the\u00a0\n, which monitors the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on apprentices, young people have at times been strongly affected by working from home (not ideal when starting an apprenticeship) and the need to quarantine.\nEven in pre-pandemic times the system has had some challenges. Some parents and students feel that young people are forced to make a career choice too early. How can a young person know what they want to do in life aged 14? they argue. But experts say doing an apprenticeship young offers valuable life experience and there is always the option of changing course later on.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nStudents make big decisions about their professional futures at a young age in Switzerland. Too early, or just right? \nThere is also pressure in some quarters \u2013 particularly among expats and professionals \u2013 for children to go down the academic route for prestige reasons. Currently only around 25% of pupils go on to study at universities.\nBut the Swiss authorities remain steadfast in their faith in the apprenticeship system and regularly promote its benefits abroad. One avenue is the World Skills \u201cvocational professions Olympics\u201d for young people, where Swiss usually do very well (the 2021 competition was cancelled due to the pandemic).\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland has won 16 medals, including five gold, at the WorldSkills competition \u2013 a kind of Olympics for trade skills \u2013 in Kazan in western Russia. \nAnd there has been international recognition: the often-cited \u201cgold standard\u201d label comes from a 2015 Harvard-backed study that deemed Switzerland top in an international comparative study of vocational education systems.\nThe United States in particular has been keen to learn about the Swiss way. In November 2021, Parmelin, then also Swiss president, travelled to Washington in person to renew a memorandum of understanding with the US on vocational training.\nAs part of previous accords, several US delegations have visited Switzerland to learn more about apprenticeships and several US states have launched initiatives to promote education and training similar to the Swiss model. Swiss companies with US locations have also been spreading the word.\nIn addition, \n has shown that many people who have started off with an apprenticeship go on to tertiary education. This is very often higher vocational education, a Swiss speciality. It is well established in areas like nursing and IT and allows people to deepen their knowledge and management skills.\nIt is also possible, via the Federal Vocational Baccalaureate, to get into Universities of Applied Sciences, Switzerland\u2019s more practically oriented universities, if you have done an apprenticeship. An extra exam (passerelle) will get you into an academic university.\nBut these higher vocational education qualifications are not always recognised abroad, especially in countries where a university education still predominates. There is currently a debate on how best to counter this.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nVocational qualifications - a pillar of the Swiss educational system - suffer from a lack of recognition abroad. This could change. \nArticles in this story\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

                "en_content": " emissions.\nIf everyone lived like the Swiss,\u00a0the world\u00a0population\u00a0would need three planets\u00a0to supply enough\u00a0natural\u00a0resources.\u00a0While the official Earth Overshoot Day falls at the end of July, Switzerland uses up its resource quota by early May.\u00a0\n\u201cDue to its comparatively high consumption level, Switzerland is one of the countries with disproportionately high environmental footprints per capita,\u201d\u00a0wrote\u00a0Karine\u00a0Siegwart, deputy director of\u00a0the\u00a0Swiss\u00a0Federal Office\u00a0for\u00a0the Environment, \n.\nSwitzerland\u2019s large footprint is partly driven by all the goods it imports. If emissions generated via imports are counted, the footprint of each resident of Switzerland is 14 tonnes of CO2 per year. In comparison, the global average is six tonnes.\n calculates that Switzerland is responsible for 2-3% of global carbon emissions \u2013 putting it on a par with countries like Indonesia, Japan and Brazil.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nA report by the McKinsey consulting firm says Switzerland has an estimated indirect influence on 2-3% of global CO2 emissions. \nPer capita,\u00a0Swiss\u00a0residents throw away more rubbish than most other Europeans.\n\u201cThe rampant selfishness of our society manifests itself in the form of rubbish and its disposal. It\u2019s a sign of our throwaway society,\u201d finds Andy\u00a0Werren, a tour guide at the\u00a0Forsthaus\u00a0power plant in Bern, which\u00a0generates electricity and heat using wood, natural gas and garbage.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nEach person living in Switzerland throws away on average over 700kg of waste per year, and recycles about half of it. \nEven if there are\u00a0systems in place to recycle\u00a0items like beverage containers,\u00a0much of the plastic packaging is difficult or\u00a0impossible to recycle.\u00a0Facilities vary by region and canton, and the price of\u00a0household\u00a0waste disposal is generally low enough\u00a0to reduce the incentive to recycle.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nWhat do a vegan, a vegetarian and a flexitarian have in common? They\u2019re all eating plastics. \nWhile much of Europe has done away with single-use plastics, Switzerland has no plans to enforce a similar ban. However, some major Swiss retailers have voluntarily decided to stop selling or giving away items like plastic straws and cutlery.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSingle-use plastic items like straws and cups are no longer allowed in much of Europe. Not so in Switzerland. \nMore\nIn the EU, many everyday single-use plastic items are banned. Should the Swiss adopt a similar law?\nSwitzerland has a dense\u00a0rail network.\u00a0Its passengers\u00a0are champions\u00a0in terms of\u00a0the number of trips and\u00a0the distances travelled per year.\u00a0\nHowever,\u00a0commuting by car is still widespread. More than half of\u00a0commuters drive to work rather than taking public transportation,\u00a0cycling\u00a0or walking.\u00a0Road transport \u2013 including buses,\u00a0service\u00a0and delivery vehicles\u00a0\u2013 accounts for\u00a0about 40% of CO\ngas emissions in Switzerland.\u00a0\nPrior to the pandemic, the\u00a0average Swiss flew\u00a0about 9,000km per year, twice as much as 20 years ago.\u00a0The number of\u00a0air travelers has increased\u00a0in recent\u00a0years. Pre-Covid-19, flying accounted\u00a0for 10% of Swiss CO2 emissions, considerably more than the global figure of 2.5%.\u00a0\n\u201cOn average, the Swiss population flies three times more often than European citizens, drives the largest cars in Europe and is one of the largest producers of waste in the world,\u201d said \n on Switzerland hitting its overshoot day months ahead of the world average: in May rather than July or August.\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s system of railways, long-distance buses and local transport is regarded as among the best in the world. \nBut there is growing public pressure to curb air travel including a debate over whether there should be a carbon tax on air tickets. Some say airfare itself should be more expensive to discourage people from using cheap tickets as an excuse for a short getaway.\u00a0\nServices like\u00a0\n\u00a0offer guilt-ridden polluters the possibility to donate to offset their carbon footprint.\u00a0\n\u201cFlying is not a human right,\u201d\u00a0says\u00a0myclimate\u00a0CEO\u00a0Stephen Neff,\u00a0\u201cIt is a luxury that we gave gotten used to in Switzerland and other countries.\u201d\nMore\n\n\n\n\nAfter two years of pandemic restrictions, demand for flights is soaring. \nWith the goal of achieving zero net emissions by 2050, the Swiss government has\u00a0adopted\u00a0CO2 reduction\u00a0measures\u00a0in the transport, construction and industrial sectors.\u00a0But in May 2020, the Swiss parliament approved a credit of nearly CHF2 billion ($2 billion) to prop up SWISS and other aviation companies affected by the coronavirus crisis.\nIn June 2021, Swiss voters had the chance to adopt a law to curb greenhouse gases. The law, part of Switzerland\u2019s strategy to abide by the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, was rejected by 51.6% of voters.\n\u201cThe \u2018No\u2019 has repercussions,\u201d said Environment Minister Simonetta Sommaruga. \u201cNow it will be difficult to achieve the climate targets.\u201d In line with the Paris accord, Switzerland aims to be climate neutral by 2050.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwiss voters' decision to reject the CO2 law makes the road to climate neutrality even longer. \nSwitzerland uses more heating oil\u00a0than\u00a0other European countries\u00a0and\u00a0is\u00a0above average\u00a0when it comes to\u00a0heat loss.\u00a0One\u00a0reason is that many of the buildings are\u00a0relatively\u00a0old, and\u00a0there is a widespread reluctance to invest\u00a0in\u00a0renovations.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nBuildings account for about a quarter of annual CO2 emissions in Switzerland. But progress has been slow to do more to save energy. \nAt the same time,\u00a0much of new construction in Switzerland consists of suburban single- and two-family homes.\u00a0Their\u00a0remote location\u00a0often\u00a0results in their tenants relying on cars to get around.\u00a0\nThe construction boom is driven to a large extent by corporate investors. They are betting on the real estate market to heat up further. That means that many of these houses\u00a0remain empty\u00a0for now\u00a0\u2013\u00a0resulting in a waste of building materials and a loss of\u00a0greenspace.\u00a0\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThere are enough of them, but in the wrong places \u2013 this is the housing market in Switzerland. Photographer Sophie Stieger has documented the paradox. \nIn landlocked Switzerland temperatures are rising faster than in regions which benefit from the ocean\u2019s cooling effect. The first video in our two-part series shows how climate change is affecting the Swiss landscape, economy and people.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe first video in our two-part series shows how climate change is affecting the Swiss landscape, economy and people. \nPart two of our climate video series looks at how the country is going about reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nPart two in our climate video series looks at how Switzerland is going about reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. \nArticles in this story\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

But civil society groups want more involvement on developing the treaty, which could take years:\n\n\n\n\nThe WHO should allow for greater civil society participation to ensure that human rights are taken into account during pandemic treaty negotiations. \nThe WHO, a UN body based in Geneva, was founded in 1948 to promote universal health care, set standards and coordinate the world's response to health emergencies.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nHow much do we really know about the World Health Organization \u2013 the agency that Covid-19 has thrust into the spotlight? \nThe WTO is another Geneva institution that has been in the eye of the storm during the pandemic. One of its most controversial recent debates has been around the vaccine inequality issue.\u00a0\nAt a delayed in-person Ministerial Conference in June 2022 it finally agreed, among other things, on a partial patent waiver for Covid-19 vaccines. Not everyone was happy, however.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference ended with a package of six trade agreements. But not everyone is rejoicing. \nThe WTO has 164 member countries and a long history:\nMore\n\n\n\n\nPast World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conferences in Geneva. \nIn recent years, Geneva\u2019s many international actors have been joined by teams of international justice investigators and experts based at the UN to gather and preserve evidence and prepare possible future criminal cases on serious international crimes committed in Syria, Myanmar and Sri Lanka.\n is\u202fhome not only to\u202fthe\u202fUnited Nations European headquarters and some 40 international organisations, but also to over 430\u202fnon-governmental organisations and 179\u00a0diplomatic missions.\u00a0There are also 17 \u201cplatforms\u201d, bringing together a range of actors in a given field, which may include governments, NGOs and international organisations but also academic and research institutions in Geneva and Switzerland.

And secondly, I\u00a0don\u2019t think that the Swiss government gets much sympathy from countries that have been invaded, like mine. Estonia was a\u00a0neutral country, and in\u00a01939-1940 it\u00a0was invaded first by\u00a0the Russians, then by\u00a0the Nazis, and then once again by\u00a0the Russians.

Why do\u00a0they [Russian soldiers in Ukraine] have to\u00a0import [back home] massive amounts of\u00a0refrigerators and washing machines? It\u2019s because they can\u2019t get the chips to\u00a0put into their guided missiles. So,\u00a0in\u00a0that sense, yes, the technological sanctions seem to\u00a0have had an\u00a0effect there.

                    "The only thing that [Vladimir] Putin respects is\u00a0force and power. What we\u00a0really need to\u00a0do\u00a0is\u00a0to\u00a0stop dithering. We\u00a0have come a\u00a0long way since last February when Germany gave 5,000\u00a0helmets [to Ukraine]. But it\u2019s quite clear that without serious military support, the Ukrainians can\u2019t win. We\u00a0would have had massive destruction in\u00a0Kyiv if\u00a0the Ukrainians had not had Patriot missiles to\u00a0shoot down the missiles that were directed at\u00a0them. We\u00a0need firm support from the West. Here, again, the West has been playing the self-deterrence card. Putin makes threats about using nuclear weapons and then everyone says, \u2018Oh no, we\u00a0can\u2019t let the Ukrainians get more equipment\u2019. Then slowly the West realises that if\u00a0we\u00a0give them anti-tank missiles and the anti-missile missiles, then it\u00a0doesn\u2019t start World War Three. And more importantly, the West does not sufficiently realise that if\u00a0you do\u00a0not help Ukraine, then you can throw out the past 80\u00a0years of\u00a0international law, because basically Putin is\u00a0saying to\u00a0the civilised world:\u00a0\u2018I can invade and there are no\u00a0consequences.\u2019",
                    "I\u00a0don\u2019t think it\u00a0makes sense to\u00a0de-escalate right now. Because that means allowing Russia to\u00a0keep and\u00a0further strengthen the defense of\u00a0territory it has illegally occupied. I would say that we\u00a0need the opposite now \u2014 a\u00a0very strong push to\u00a0liberate occupied Ukrainian areas, especially as we\u00a0know that wherever they occupy territory they commit the most horrible war crimes. So when\u00a0I hear people saying, \u2018We\u00a0should de-escalate and have a\u00a0ceasefire\u2019, that\u2019s basically saying: \u2018Go\u00a0ahead, Russia, rape, kill, torture\u2019. So\u00a0de-escalation is\u00a0something you can say if\u00a0you\u2019re sitting in\u00a0a bath and having a\u00a0ros\u00e9. But we\u2019re talking about torture victims and rape victims.",
                    "What we\u00a0are seeing in\u00a0Europe is\u00a0a\u00a0division between countries that have experienced Soviet occupation and those that have not. In\u00a0this country, everybody has a\u00a0relative or\u00a0a\u00a0grandparent, someone who has suffered under Soviet Russian rule. People call the Estonian prime minister [Kaja Kallas] a\u00a0\u2018hawk\u2019. Her mother was six months old when [in\u00a01940] she was deported in\u00a0a\u00a0cattle car to\u00a0Siberia and was in\u00a0Siberia until she was seven years old, and only then came back to\u00a0Estonia. So we\u00a0have experience and this kind of patronising attitude of\u00a0people who have never gone through this, telling\u00a0us that we\u00a0don\u2019t know how to\u00a0deal with Russia, is\u00a0obnoxious. It\u2019s disgusting.",
                    "Well, I\u00a0mean the inability of\u00a0especially Westerners, European politicians to\u00a0understand what is\u00a0happening and discounting the experiences of\u00a0what people in\u00a0the East have gone through. This has bothered me\u00a0since I read a\u00a0review in\u00a0",

This is\u00a0the bizarre inability of\u00a0people to\u00a0look at\u00a0what happened. And you can be lectured for years by\u00a0Western politicians about how they know how to\u00a0get along with the Russians when they have had no\u00a0experience with the Russians.",

That affects everyone. The short-term problems for people here simply do\u00a0not matter when it\u00a0comes to\u00a0the war crimes being committed right now in Ukraine.",

                "en_title": "Ukraine war: former Estonian president urges Switzerland to lift ban on arms exports",
                "en_content": "Ilves says he\u00a0cannot understand the logic behind the Swiss government\u2019s refusal to\u00a0lift a long-standing ban on the re-export of arms by a third country. \u201cIt\u00a0is\u00a0like selling an\u00a0anti-tank weapon to use it\u00a0for\u00a0decoration,\u201d\u00a0he says.\nToomas Hendrik llves is an Estonian politician and diplomat. He is a former president of\u00a0Estonia (2006-2016) and a former member of\u00a0the European parliament. His parents fled to\u00a0the United States after the Soviet Union invaded and occupied\u00a0Estonia and the two other Baltic states in\u00a01940.\nI\u00a0found it\u00a0rather bizarre when the [Swiss] president [Alain Berset] said, \u201cWe\u00a0can\u2019t export weapons to\u00a0be\u00a0used in\u00a0war\u2019. So\u00a0why do\u00a0you produce weapons? I\u00a0mean, are you producing museum pieces? What is\u00a0the point? So shut down your weapons industry. He just made Switzerland look ridiculous.\n \nNuclear weapons get old, as does the technology in them.\nFirst, let\u2019s face\u00a0it, it\u2019s very easy to\u00a0be\u00a0neutral when you\u2019re surrounded by\u00a0NATO. And secondly, I\u00a0don\u2019t think that the Swiss government gets much sympathy from countries that have been invaded, like mine. Estonia was a\u00a0neutral country, and in\u00a01939-1940 it\u00a0was invaded first by\u00a0the Russians, then by\u00a0the Nazis, and then once again by\u00a0the Russians. Neutrality is\u00a0a\u00a0fine thing to\u00a0have if\u00a0you\u2019re surrounded by\u00a0NATO. But it\u00a0doesn\u2019t work.\nHe\u00a0has managed to\u00a0basically destroy the last vestiges of\u00a0democracy in\u00a0Russia and\u00a0has eliminated any form of opposition either through imprisonment or murder.\u00a0So\u00a0that\u2019s his impact. We\u2019re dealing with an\u00a0almost totalitarian dictatorship.\nWell, certainly, at\u00a0the technical end of\u00a0things. Why do\u00a0they [Russian soldiers in Ukraine] have to\u00a0import [back home] massive amounts of\u00a0refrigerators and washing machines? It\u2019s because they can\u2019t get the chips to\u00a0put into their guided missiles. So,\u00a0in\u00a0that sense, yes, the technological sanctions seem to\u00a0have had an\u00a0effect there. And it\u00a0seems Russia is working very hard to\u00a0get around the sanctions on oil. Sanctions take a\u00a0while to\u00a0have an\u00a0effect. Meanwhile there\u2019s a\u00a0lot of\u00a0sanction-busting going on\u00a0by\u00a0Turkey, Kazakhstan and Armenia. That\u2019s always a\u00a0problem. There can be\u00a0an\u00a0agreement among the European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea and so\u00a0forth, but countries like Turkey, Armenia, Kazakhstan are trying to\u00a0make a\u00a0profit from\u00a0it.\nThe only thing that [Vladimir] Putin respects is\u00a0force and power. What we\u00a0really need to\u00a0do\u00a0is\u00a0to\u00a0stop dithering. We\u00a0have come a\u00a0long way since last February when Germany gave 5,000\u00a0helmets [to Ukraine]. But it\u2019s quite clear that without serious military support, the Ukrainians can\u2019t win. We\u00a0would have had massive destruction in\u00a0Kyiv if\u00a0the Ukrainians had not had Patriot missiles to\u00a0shoot down the missiles that were directed at\u00a0them. We\u00a0need firm support from the West. Here, again, the West has been playing the self-deterrence card. Putin makes threats about using nuclear weapons and then everyone says, \u2018Oh no, we\u00a0can\u2019t let the Ukrainians get more equipment\u2019. Then slowly the West realises that if\u00a0we\u00a0give them anti-tank missiles and the anti-missile missiles, then it\u00a0doesn\u2019t start World War Three. And more importantly, the West does not sufficiently realise that if\u00a0you do\u00a0not help Ukraine, then you can throw out the past 80\u00a0years of\u00a0international law, because basically Putin is\u00a0saying to\u00a0the civilised world:\u00a0\u2018I can invade and there are no\u00a0consequences.\u2019\nI\u00a0don\u2019t think it\u00a0makes sense to\u00a0de-escalate right now. Because that means allowing Russia to\u00a0keep and\u00a0further strengthen the defense of\u00a0territory it has illegally occupied. I would say that we\u00a0need the opposite now \u2014 a\u00a0very strong push to\u00a0liberate occupied Ukrainian areas, especially as we\u00a0know that wherever they occupy territory they commit the most horrible war crimes. So when\u00a0I hear people saying, \u2018We\u00a0should de-escalate and have a\u00a0ceasefire\u2019, that\u2019s basically saying: \u2018Go\u00a0ahead, Russia, rape, kill, torture\u2019. So\u00a0de-escalation is\u00a0something you can say if\u00a0you\u2019re sitting in\u00a0a bath and having a\u00a0ros\u00e9. But we\u2019re talking about torture victims and rape victims.\nWhat we\u00a0are seeing in\u00a0Europe is\u00a0a\u00a0division between countries that have experienced Soviet occupation and those that have not. In\u00a0this country, everybody has a\u00a0relative or\u00a0a\u00a0grandparent, someone who has suffered under Soviet Russian rule. People call the Estonian prime minister [Kaja Kallas] a\u00a0\u2018hawk\u2019. Her mother was six months old when [in\u00a01940] she was deported in\u00a0a\u00a0cattle car to\u00a0Siberia and was in\u00a0Siberia until she was seven years old, and only then came back to\u00a0Estonia. So we\u00a0have experience and this kind of patronising attitude of\u00a0people who have never gone through this, telling\u00a0us that we\u00a0don\u2019t know how to\u00a0deal with Russia, is\u00a0obnoxious. It\u2019s disgusting.\nWell, I\u00a0mean the inability of\u00a0especially Westerners, European politicians to\u00a0understand what is\u00a0happening and discounting the experiences of\u00a0what people in\u00a0the East have gone through. This has bothered me\u00a0since I read a\u00a0review in\u00a0\n of\u00a0Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\u2019s \n. And the reviewer said: \u2018Oh, Solzhenitsyn doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about\u2019. This is\u00a0the bizarre inability of\u00a0people to\u00a0look at\u00a0what happened. And you can be lectured for years by\u00a0Western politicians about how they know how to\u00a0get along with the Russians when they have had no\u00a0experience with the Russians.\nWe\u2019re in\u00a0a\u00a0war. We\u00a0all make sacrifices in\u00a0a\u00a0war. We\u00a0pay\u00a0higher energy costs because we don\u2019t use Russian oil and gas. That affects everyone. The short-term problems for people here simply do\u00a0not matter when it\u00a0comes to\u00a0the war crimes being committed right now in Ukraine.\nThose exceptions are there already. That\u2019s not a\u00a0problem. As\u00a0you know there are no\u00a0restrictions on\u00a0humanitarian assistance. And that\u2019s always been there even during the Iranian sanctions.\nI\u00a0don\u2019t think Ukrainians who happen to\u00a0live in\u00a0Ukraine should be\u00a0impacted by\u00a0Russian war crimes. I\u00a0don\u2019t care about people who might be\u00a0inconvenienced by\u00a0sanctions when we\u00a0have war crimes ongoing in\u00a0Ukraine. And I\u00a0don\u2019t see those people protesting either. So\u00a0go\u00a0protest. Maybe it will change my\u00a0mind.\nYes, there are some people in\u00a0prison, but \n that support for war has increased [in Russia]. You still have the daughter\u00a0of [Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson Dmitry] Peskov who is\u00a0an\u00a0intern in\u00a0the European Parliament, t\n or \nbuying things for tens of\u00a0thousands of\u00a0euros because she\u2019s let in. Those things should not happen.\n:\nI really know nothing about Swiss banks doing business with Russia.

This S status was never intended to allow a long-term stay in Switzerland.\nAt present, it is impossible to predict when the war in Ukraine will end and refugees be able to return home safely, according to a government \n. Nevertheless, the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM), in collaboration with the cantons, has drawn up a provisional plan for implementing the lifting of S status, which will serve as a basis for future political decisions.\nThis plan sets out operational measures and contains recommendations on other aspects, such as departure deadlines, derogations and return assistance arrangements. As soon as the S status can actually be lifted, these recommendations will be reviewed and adapted if necessary.\nLast November, the government decided not to lift protection status S before March 2024, unless the situation in Ukraine stabilises on a long-term basis. It will decide again on this issue in the coming weeks.\nAccording to the latest SEM figures published on Friday on X (formerly Twitter), 65,650 Ukrainians currently enjoy S status. This status has expired for 16,869 people.\nThis news story has been written and carefully fact-checked by an external editorial team.

                    "The plans are based on a lifting of the S status two to three years after the start of the war, i.e. in 2024 or 2025, Keystone-SDA writes. At that point, some 70,000 Ukrainians should be able to return home, 80% of them voluntarily; most are families who were separated due to the men remaining in Ukraine. In addition, the majority have a biometric passport and therefore do not need a visa or replacement travel document.",
                    "The remaining 20%, or 14,000 people, would let the departure deadline expire. This percentage is expected to vary, depending on the length of the war and the degree of damage in Ukraine. The longer the stay in Switzerland, the less likely a person will be willing to leave of their own free will, the plan says. Furthermore, after five years of uninterrupted stay, they could obtain a Swiss B permit, valid for five years.",
                    "The report therefore concludes that everything must be done to encourage voluntary departures. The departure time should neither be too short \u2013 to allow for logistical planning of the return \u2013 nor too long, so as not to encourage people to postpone it.",

                "en_content": "Currently, it is impossible to predict when the war in Ukraine will end and when refugees will be able to return to their country safely, the government said last Friday \n of the provisional strategy.\nThe full details of the concept, worked up by the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) in collaboration with cantonal authorities, were transmitted to various media including Keystone-SDA on Wednesday.\nThe plans are based on a lifting of the S status two to three years after the start of the war, i.e. in 2024 or 2025, Keystone-SDA writes. At that point, some 70,000 Ukrainians should be able to return home, 80% of them voluntarily; most are families who were separated due to the men remaining in Ukraine. In addition, the majority have a biometric passport and therefore do not need a visa or replacement travel document.\nThe remaining 20%, or 14,000 people, would let the departure deadline expire. This percentage is expected to vary, depending on the length of the war and the degree of damage in Ukraine. The longer the stay in Switzerland, the less likely a person will be willing to leave of their own free will, the plan says. Furthermore, after five years of uninterrupted stay, they could obtain a Swiss B permit, valid for five years.\nThe report therefore concludes that everything must be done to encourage voluntary departures. The departure time should neither be too short \u2013 to allow for logistical planning of the return \u2013 nor too long, so as not to encourage people to postpone it.\nTo this end, the plan suggests a time frame of six to nine months.\nThe situations of vulnerable people would be examined on a case-by-case basis, while the overall procedure would be modelled on that governing the returns of asylum seekers.\nVoluntary departures should be carried out independently and by land. Forced returns by air must be the last resort. Special cases requiring special support, for the approximately 1,000 unaccompanied minors, around 1,600 people over 75 and people with health problems, would not be prioritised.\nInitial financial assistance is considered. It could be uniform or decreasing, in order to encourage people not to wait for the end of the deadline to leave. The articulated amounts vary between CHF1000 and CHF4000 ($1,090 and $4,355) francs per person depending on the departure phases.\nThis news story has been written and carefully fact-checked by an external editorial team.

                    "While the EU has announced that it is freezing its development aid to the Palestinians, Switzerland is maintaining its financial support for the time being. There is no indication that these funds are not being properly used,\u201d Cassis said.",
                    "Switzerland funds the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), as well as around 30 NGOs at present. As for the controversial aid to UNRWA, there is no alternative. Until now, Switzerland has supported the relief agency to the tune of around CHF20 million ($22 million) a year.",
                    "The first priority is to support the Swiss people on the ground, Cassis said. For the time being, he had no information about Swiss victims or hostages. Foreign ministry staff in both Tel Aviv and Ramallah are safe and the Swiss embassy in Tel Aviv and the representation office in Ramallah remain operational.",

This is the objective of the new taskforce headed by the head of the ministry\u2019s Middle East and North Africa (MENA) division, Maya Tissafi.\nSwitzerland is ready to provide diplomatic support to the parties and the states in the region to work towards de-escalation. It is committed to a two-state solution negotiated by both parties in accordance with international law, Cassis said. In his view, it is likely that Iran was behind the attack, as it was very well orchestrated.\nBern\u2019s stance towards Hamas has nonetheless been criticised by many politicians and organisations in Switzerland. On Monday the Switzerland-Israel parliamentary group called on the government and parliament to reconsider their position and their relations with Hamas, and also with the Iranian regime.\n\u201cOur legal situation does not currently allow us to list terrorist organisations,\u201d Cassis pointed out. This does not mean that we cannot act against terrorists, he added, referring to the procedure against al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, which are banned by law.\nWhile the EU has announced that it is freezing its development aid to the Palestinians, Switzerland is maintaining its financial support for the time being. There is no indication that these funds are not being properly used,\u201d Cassis said.\nSwitzerland funds the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), as well as around 30 NGOs at present. As for the controversial aid to UNRWA, there is no alternative. Until now, Switzerland has supported the relief agency to the tune of around CHF20 million ($22 million) a year.\nThe first priority is to support the Swiss people on the ground, Cassis said. For the time being, he had no information about Swiss victims or hostages. Foreign ministry staff in both Tel Aviv and Ramallah are safe and the Swiss embassy in Tel Aviv and the representation office in Ramallah remain operational.\nThe airline SWISS will be repatriating Swiss nationals from Israel on Tuesday, it announced on Monday. A return evacuation flight between Zurich and Tel Aviv will be operated at the request of the foreign ministry. It was already fully booked on Monday. However, SWISS is cancelling all flights to and from Tel Aviv until Saturday October 14 inclusive.\nAround 28,000 Swiss nationals are officially registered in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Some 430 people with links to Switzerland are registered in the Travel Admin app.\nTravel to Israel remains inadvisable, said the foreign ministry. As a result, Swiss travel agencies must cancel their holiday offers until further notice and work to repatriate tourists.\nThis news story has been written and carefully fact-checked by an external editorial team.

The centre-right Radical-Liberal Party also issued a \n demanding the government classify Hamas as a terrorist organisation.\n\u201cUp to now, it was acceptable to talk to all parties in the region. These attacks no longer permit this. Dialogue with people who plan and support such acts is not possible,\u201d it declared. The party called for a review of Swiss development aid to Palestine with a view to possibly suspending support to Hamas-related organisations.\nSwitzerland \n around CHF20 million a year to the regular budget of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and to around 30 NGOs on the spot (CHF5 million in 2022).\nThe Swiss-Israel parliamentary group also urged the Federal Council and parliament to reconsider their position and their relations with Hamas and Iran.\nMembers of the\u00a0\u201cFriendship Group Switzerland \u2013 Palestine\u201d, a ten-member parliamentary group, seem to be publicly distancing themselves from Hamas after the assault.\n\u201cHamas is a criminal organisation and a corrupt bunch,\u201d Fabian Molina of the left-wing Social Democratic Party \n \n newspaper on Monday. Liberal Green parliamentarian Beat Flach described Saturday\u2019s attack an \u201cabsolute disaster\u201d.\nBut Molina still accused both sides of violations: \u201cAbducting Israeli civilians and firing rockets at cities is vile. But cutting off electricity to Palestinian hospitals out of revenge is just as wrong.\u201d\nGeri M\u00fcller, president of the relatively small\u00a0Swiss-Palestine Society, warned against banning Hamas, which he said would prevent Switzerland from pursuing its \u201cgood negotiating work\u201d.\u00a0\u201cViolence is never acceptable, also for Israel,\u201d the former Green Party parliamentarian\u00a0told the \n, adding that in the past six months, Jewish settlers had attacked 70 Palestinian villages.\nAround two million people are locked up in the Gaza Strip, so it\u2019s not surprising that extreme reactions occur, added M\u00fcller. \u201cIsrael is an apartheid state.\u00a0Period.\u00a0If Switzerland wants to declare Hamas a terrorist organisation, it must also call Israeli state terrorism by its name.\u201d\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwiss nationals in Israel should be aware of what\u2019s going on and what to do, says the Swiss foreign ministry. \nArticles in this story\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

Switzerland contributes around CHF20 million a year to the regular budget of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and to around 30 NGOs on the ground in Palestine (CHF5 million in 2022). According to Sass\u00f2li, it would be near impossible to guarantee that all these organisations have nothing to do with Hamas. \u00a0",

However, the recent attack prompted an urgent review of the EU\u2019s assistance to Palestine. \u00a0",
                    "\u201cOur humanitarian support to the Palestinian people is not in question. Yet it is important that we carefully review our financial assistance for Palestine. EU funding has never and will never go to Hamas or any terrorist entity. So we will now again review the entire portfolio in light of an evolving situation on the ground,\u201d said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen ",

                "en_content": "On October 11, the Swiss government took an unprecedented position after the attacks on Israeli civilians by Islamist group Hamas from the Gaza Strip. \u00a0\n\u201cThe Federal Council takes the stance that Hamas should be designated as a terrorist organisation. It has tasked the METF (Middle East Task Force) to examine the legal options to this end,\u201d said an \n from the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. \u00a0\nOnly groups linked to al-Qaeda and the so-called Islamic State are currently recognised under Swiss law as terrorist groups. Even though Hamas has been designated a terrorist organisation by the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and the European Union (EU), previous attempts by Swiss parliamentarians have all failed. \u00a0\n\u201cUnder existing law this can be done only if the United Nations Security Council designates Hamas as a terrorist organisation, which it has not done. Hence, Switzerland will need to create a special legislation which would need to be approved by parliament,\u201d Marco Sass\u00f2li, professor of international law at the University of Geneva told SWI swissinfo.ch. \u00a0\nEven then it is unlikely to be a permanent ban. Despite the fact that al-Qaeda and the so-called Islamic State were designated terrorist groups by the United Nations, the Swiss government could only institute temporary bans on them that have to be renewed every few years. \u00a0\nThen there is the practicality of implementing a ban. Switzerland contributes around CHF20 million a year to the regular budget of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and to around 30 NGOs on the ground in Palestine (CHF5 million in 2022). According to Sass\u00f2li, it would be near impossible to guarantee that all these organisations have nothing to do with Hamas. \u00a0\n\u201cWe all condemn the attack by Hamas but they still run the Gaza strip. If you want to deliver food, medicine or help children there you will have to speak to Hamas. You cannot fly in by helicopter!\u201d says Sass\u00f2li.\u00a0\nThe EU is still managing to send aid to Palestinians despite putting Hamas on its terror group list as far back as 2003, a decision that was unsuccessfully challenged several times in court. However, the recent attack prompted an urgent review of the EU\u2019s assistance to Palestine. \u00a0\n\u201cOur humanitarian support to the Palestinian people is not in question. Yet it is important that we carefully review our financial assistance for Palestine. EU funding has never and will never go to Hamas or any terrorist entity. So we will now again review the entire portfolio in light of an evolving situation on the ground,\u201d said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen \n yesterday. \u00a0\nBut Switzerland is in a better position than the EU to juggle having Hamas on its terror list while continuing to provide much-needed aid to Palestinians. \u00a0\n\u201cIf Switzerland does pass a special legislation designating Hamas as a terrorist organisation it should have an exception clause for genuine and neutral humanitarian service to the population. There is already such an exception in the Swiss penal code provision outlawing activities considered as supporting terrorism,\u201d says Sass\u00f2li.\u00a0\nHe is referring to \nof the Swiss criminal code that deals with penalties for supporting a \u201ccriminal or terrorist organisation\u201d. It has an exemption clause says that the penalty \u201cdoes not apply to humanitarian services provided by an impartial humanitarian organisation, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, in accordance with the common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949\u201d.\u00a0\nThe trickier question will be channeling money to people in need in Palestine through the Swiss financial system. \u00a0\n\u201cEven with an exception for humanitarian assistance it will have an indirect freezing effect. No bank will transfer money to a place run by a group on a terror list,\u201d says Sass\u00f2li.\u00a0\nReputation and integrity are important key factors for the Swiss financial centre, according to Robert Reinecke, a spokesperson for Swiss Bankers Association.\u00a0\n\u201cThe anti-money laundering measures have been continuously expanded and tightened in recent years. Banks are subject to comprehensive due diligence and reporting obligations to prevent money laundering and financial crime,\u201d he says.\u00a0\nDeclaring Hamas a terrorist organisation could also affect Switzerland\u2019s ability to serve as a mediator or messenger in the Middle East. The Alpine nation\u2019s neutrality has made it a trusted partner in the region with neutral Switzerland currently representing the diplomatic interests of Iran in Egypt and Canada, the US in Iran and Iran in Saudi Arabia (and vice versa). \u00a0\nAccording to the government\u2019s response to a parliamentary question in 2021, Switzerland\u2019s relations with Israel and Hamas are also on a good footing.\u00a0\n\u201cSwitzerland\u2019s policy of inclusive contact and good offices in this context is appreciated by key international players such as the US and the EU, particularly during crises. Israel is also regularly informed by Switzerland of its contacts with Hamas,\u201d the government said. \u00a0\nSwitzerland\u2019s diplomatic value in the region would thus be affected if it blacklists Hamas, according to Sass\u00f2li. \u00a0\n\u201cNegotiations are on with the United States over Israeli hostages that also involve Turkey and Qatar. It will be difficult for Switzerland to play a role in such negotiations if Swiss law considers Hamas a terrorist organisation,\u201d he says.\u00a0\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

Bl\u00e4ttler said he could not give more details about the case in order not to jeopardise it.\nIn the case of the \n killed in the October 7 Hamas attack, as well as in the case of the Swede recently killed in Belgium and who \n, the OAG is also examining whether to open proceedings.\nAs for the suspicions of financing a terrorist organisation, the question must be clarified whether Hamas is a terrorist group according to the Swiss Criminal Code, Bl\u00e4ttler said. Currently only Al-Qaeda and Islamic State are defined as such. It would be easier for the proceedings if Hamas was officially considered such an organisation, Bl\u00e4ttler said.\nIt would take years for an organisation like Hamas to be legally considered a terrorist organisation in Switzerland, Bl\u00e4ttler added. The individual elements of terrorist offences would have to be proven, and appeals would undoubtedly end up before the Federal Court.\nAsked about a Swiss investigation into terrorist financing that was initiated 20 years ago and, according to SRF, was closed without charges, Bl\u00e4ttler said it was difficult to prove the individual elements of the offence.\nOn October 11, the Swiss government announced its intention to classify Hamas as a terrorist organisation and have it banned. A task force reporting directly to the government is to examine the legal options for doing this.\nBl\u00e4tter added that some 70 cases related to terrorism in the broader sense were currently pending before the OAG. He also said that there were too few criminal police officers at the federal level \u2013 not only in the area of counter-terrorism, but also in the area of combating criminal organisations.\nThis news story has been written and carefully fact-checked by an external editorial team.

In particular, I was violently attacked by the representative of the United States on 22 May at a briefing to the United Nations Security Council. I resign to bring more serenity to UNRWA.\u201d\nThis former ICRC framework rejected all charges against him. The now former Commissioner General\nstated in particular that \u201cthe ongoing investigation has not updated any cases of corruption, fraud or mismanagement. And the claim of favouritism to a collaborator or liaison with this collaborator was found to be not existing in the internal report.\u201d\n7.30 p.m. of 6.11.19\nEarlier in Wednesday\u2019s day, the UN had announced that the Secretary-General (Antonio Guterres) had received an investigation report from the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS).\n) of the UN concerning allegations against Pierre Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl: \"The preliminary findings of this OIOS report exclude the fraud or misappropriation of operational funds by the Commissioner-General.

In anticipation of the results of the OIOS investigation due at the end of November, Switzerland maintains the suspension of its contributions to UNRWA\u2019s projects: \u201cDFAE supports UNRWA\u2019s reforms, which should lead to good governance of the aid organization and effective use of funds. UNRWA is a key player in stability and security in the Middle East. This helps to improve the prospects of Palestinian refugees.\nDuring a trip to Jordan last year, the head of the DFAE had questioned the usefulness of the UN agency, believing that it was part of the problem rather than its solution. Ignazio Cassis had also suggested that Bern could further assist the institutions of the States hosting Palestinian refugees rather than UNRWA.

In Hamas schools. Is that what Mr. Cassis wants?\"\nThat is not the wish of the United Nations. \"The Secretary General (Antonio Guterres) reaffirms his support for UNRWA's excellent work, essential for the well-being of Palestinian refugees. It is vital at this moment that Member States and other partners remain involved in UNRWA and in the services it provides,\" said UN spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric.\nThe moment is indeed critical. The UN General Assembly will soon renew for three years the mandate of UNRWA, despite the strong opposition of the United States and Israel.\nAt the request of the Swiss Parliament, the Federal Council will present its own report on UNRWA's \"cooperation, efficiency and transparency\".\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

As the Commissioner-General of the UN agency since April, this former ICRC delegate succeeded Pierre Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, who was forced to resign in 2019 following charges on his way of management. This crisis, like the interrogations of Ignazio Cassis on the usefulness of UNRWA, seems to belong to the past.\nThe Swiss government\nfor 2021-2022 the same level\nin previous years, 20 million francs per year. Bern adds 1 million francs to the programme set up to deal with the pandemic. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DFAE) will also support the reforms undertaken by the institution and the international conference to be held by UNRWA next spring to sustain its future.\nGood news, while the United Nations agency in charge of Palestinian refugees in the Middle East is still uninsured to be able to pay the salaries for this end of the year to its 30,000 employees. What is to put at risk the schools, health centres and social services that UNRWA maintains in its camps.\nPhilippe Lazzarini: We are in an exceptional and dangerous situation that the agency has never known in its entire history. It is comparable to an aircraft that will soon have to operate an emergency landing to avoid the crash.\nThis liquidity crisis adds anxiety to a region already under tension, including the effects of the Covid-19, which reinforces the despair of Palestinian refugees in the face of a future that seems to be overwhelmed. These budgetary problems happen at the worst: faced with ever-growing needs, we have never been so weakened financially.\nIt has been months since I announced that the agency will no longer be able to maintain its services. We're there. Since November 9, we have no cash left to pay for the salaries of November and December.\nThe objective of my calls is to maintain all the activities and teams necessary for the operation of schools for more than half a million girls and boys, our health centres in the middle of this Covid-19 pandemic, and minimal social services in the face of an abject level of poverty in the region. If by the end of the month, I have no information from donors, I will have to resolve to make decisions that will have an impact on our services. This will certainly create a panic among already desperate refugees.\nWidely. Our exchanges took place well, including budget. Bern supports our reform agenda, which is at the heart of UNRWA\u2019s strategy for the coming years. And I was also able to speak with a series of parliamentarians concerned with our action and the situation in the Middle East.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nIs the head of Swiss diplomacy annoying or is it launching a test balloon to reorient Swiss diplomacy in the Middle East?\nIn my opinion, the page is turned. This is the information I receive from donors and member States. The team that was in place last year was replaced. Many reforms have been put in place to ensure more efficient, transparent and team-friendly management. I am totally involved in the pursuit and deepening of these changes. And the echoes I receive from our partners show that trust is being fully restored.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nUNRWA's Commissioner General resigned. Switzerland has explained this on the Swiss public television (RTS).\nThe current funding model is not tenable. Year after year, the gap continues to grow between the cost of services we provide and the resources available. The political support we obtain is poorly translated financially.\nThat is why we will call for an international conference for next spring. We will present the strategy of the coming years with the aim of ensuring the contributions of member States and above all promoting commitments over several years to allow us to have a little more predictability in the organization of our actions.\nThe quotas of the Member States cover only the management structure of the organization, which is 150 out of the 30\u2019000 employees of the UN agency.\nThe regular budget for 2020 is more than $800 million, in addition to three emergency programmes, which represent a total of approximately $500 million. About half of each\nhave been funded to date.\nEstablished by the United Nations in 1949, after the First Arab-Israeli War, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)\n) today stands at 5.8 million Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank.\nThe agency hosts 711 schools that now host more than half a million children. It manages 144 health centres attended by 3.6 million Palestinian refugees. UNRWA also provides support to some 270,000 refugees in the form of targeted food or monetary aid.\nCommissioner-General of UNRWA since March 2020, Philippe Lazzarini is one of the highest Swiss personalities in the United Nations.\nI also expect that friendly countries such as Switzerland will help us to obtain this support from member States so that UNRWA can re-appropriate the objectives and strategy of its mission.\nIn fact, the agency is mandated to deliver quasi-state services: education, care and social services for a population of 5.8 million people. But we do not have any of the revenue opportunities that governments have, be it taxes or loans. We depend on these voluntary contributions that are today at an extremely low level, comparable to 2012, while since then, the region has gone through multiple crises that have led to a significant increase in needs.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nUNRWA spokesman, Tamara Alrifai highlights the challenges of international aid for the reconstruction of a Lebanon on the edge of the abyss.\nThe United States has been an important partner of the agency in recent decades. I hope this partnership will resume when the new administration is in place. In recent years, we have maintained contacts with members of the congress, Senate and administration at the field level. And the information we receive today indicates a willingness to resume this partnership. It remains to be known when and how much.\nI recently visited the Gulf countries, especially to assess the impact of these new political developments. Every time, my interlocutors assured me that they would maintain their commitment in the coming years. But for the regular budget of 2020, this commitment has still not materialized. I am hopeful that it will be realized by the end of the year, as well as on the medium term and at our international conference next spring.\nOur action is social and humanitarian. But it deploys in a highly politicized context. I remain convinced that it is not in the interest of anyone in this region to see the instability in the Palestinian camps, whether in Lebanon, Gaza, East Jerusalem or the West Bank. If UNRWA was to be perceived as unable to fulfil its mandate because of a lack of resources, it could only fuel the feeling that it had been abandoned by the international community. In such a volatile region, it is an additional despair that must be avoided at all costs.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "en_content": "The Geneva Initiative, signed in October 2003 between two former ministers, one Israeli and one Palestinian, and under the leadership of Alexis Keller, a Swiss university, was to be if it is not\na final solution to the Middle East conflict at least a first step towards a comprehensive resolution.\nShe was \u201cthe first initiative of the genre that proposed something concrete to resolve the Middle East conflict\u201d, recalls Mohamed Ch\u00e9rif, former correspondent in Geneva of swissinfo.ch who had covered the event.\n2003 is the year in which the United States invades Iraq. It is also the year when the second Palestinian intifada is at its peak. This movement of violence in which Palestinians face Israeli soldiers with stones and suicide attacks begins after the failure of Camp David\u2019s agreements in 2000. Israel bombs the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and the West Bank in the country. A total of 3,000 to 5,000 deaths will be deplored on the Palestinian side and 1000 on the Israeli side.\nAlexis Keller also remembers the optimism that had welcomed the initiative, whose idea had emerged in Geneva in 2001 before being concluded in Amman, Jordan, two and a half years later. \u201cThere was an atmosphere of mutual respect and recognition between the two sides, with a real joy and a feeling of writing history,\u201d he says.\nHowever, twenty after the signing, it is important to note that the Geneva Initiative has had no impact on the ground: the Israeli settlements are slipping and the two countries are anchored in a wrought conflict that causes death almost daily. Switzerland announced that it would no longer fund the Initiative after 2023.\nThis decision is surprising in the eyes of Alexis Keller, who explains that \u201cthis text remains the most successful model of the two-state solution, especially since the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAE) has not announced any concrete alternative\u201d.\nThe Geneva Initiative is primarily the work of Geneva-based academic Alexis Keller and his father, former diplomat and banker. Both are committed personally and financially to the negotiation process that often takes place in the family chalet, in the Bernese Alps, starting in January 2001.\nAlmost two years later, on 12 October 2003, efforts resulted in a text of nearly 100 pages signed by former Minister Yossi Beilin and a Palestinian counterpart, Yasser Abed Rabbo, Jordan.\nThe Geneva Initiative provides for major concessions from both sides and addresses all substantive issues of the conflict: the status of Jerusalem, the fate of Palestinian refugees and the borderline.\nIt was drafted by members of Israeli and Palestinian civil society. The text was distributed to the homes of both camps. He was supported by former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and former President of the United States, Jimmy Carter.\nThe Israeli government was firmly opposed to this text, and some circles criticized what they saw as a \u201cinterference\u201d of Switzerland in Israeli affairs.\nThe Geneva Initiative is not the first attempt to anchor peace between Israel and the Palestinian territories. There were the Oslo Accords 1 and 2, in 1993 and 1995, the Camp David Agreement (July 2000) and a peace plan presented by the then American President, Bill Clinton (December 2000).\nThe Geneva initiative is distinguished by its desire to address in a single document the differences between the two protagonists: the status of Jerusalem, the evacuation of almost all of the West Bank of Jewish settlers, and the compensation of Palestinian refugees.\nIt was supposed to be a first step to put around the table the then Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, and the leader of the Palestinian authority, Yasser Arafat. What is innovative in the approach is that it is drafted by members of Israeli and Palestinian civil society, and not negotiated by heads of state.\n\"She addresses front issues immediately, then integrating results into a broader process,\" said Alexis Keller at the launch.\nBut backwards, one can wonder if she was not simply scheduled to fail. The Initiative never gave rise to a great civil solidarity movement as the signatories wanted.\nSwiss diplomacy was divided, Ariel Sharon never intended to validate it and Yasser Arafat supported it from the lips.\nFor Alexis Keller, three reasons can explain this failure: \u201cSwiss had not made enough commitment, as Norway did with the Oslo Accords. There was also the strong rejection by Israel and the lack of support from the Arab countries.\"\nIn Switzerland too, the initiative divided from its beginnings. It was pushed by Micheline Calmy-Rey, a member of the Socialist Party and then head of the DFAE. She herself was isolated within the government. She has never obtained a parliamentary majority to support her approach.\nThis shy support from Switzerland, which has also declined over time -\n- led to a lack of willingness to implement on site.\nAccording to an expert who collaborates on projects with the DFAE and prefers to remain anonymous, the Initiative demonstrates \u201cthe naivety and lack of knowledge of the local dynamics that dominate the Middle East\u201d. The text appeared on civil society and on a relay of Israeli and Palestinian public opinion that never took place.\nA new evaluation of the Initiative by Switzerland in 2020 concluded that its effectiveness had declined due to its lack of political support in Israel and Palestine. In January 2022,\n.\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs then announced a new strategy for the promotion of peace and development in the Middle East and North Africa that will take over in 2023. Bern also plans to move the headquarters of the Swiss cooperation in Jerusalem to Ramallah, as required by the Israelis.\nSwitzerland insists that the final end of the Initiative does not sign its disengagement from the region. The Confederation will continue to spend CHF 1.8 million per year for the promotion of peace and human rights. \u201cThe search for a political solution to the conflict in the Middle East is a priority of the Federal Council\u2019s MENA (Moyen Orient and North Africa) 2021-2024 strategy,\u201d says Andreas Heller, DFAE Spokesperson:\nIn addition, Switzerland has created a new post to \u201cpromote concrete solutions in the region\u201d, with the appointment of a Swiss Envoy for the Middle East. This special envoy will not replace regional ambassadors on site.\nA policy widely criticized by experts and NGOs, which criticize Switzerland for a change in its foreign policy in the region. The decision to transfer the Jerusalem cooperation office to Ramallah can be \u201cinterpreted as an implicit recognition of the annexation of East Jerusalem by the State of Israel\u201d, says Nago Humbert, founder of M\u00e9decins du monde Suisse.\nThe statement of Ignazio Cassis, then Minister of Foreign Affairs, on a trip to the region in 2018, goes in the same direction when he says to the press: \u201cAs Arabs are not ready to grant Israel the right to exist, Israel feels threatened in its existence and will defend itself.\u201d\nFor Alexis Keller, Switzerland\u2019s current policy in the Middle East \u201cmasks the opacity of Swiss foreign policy, because if Switzerland puts on humanitarian aid and development assistance, it returns to what it was doing before the Geneva Initiative, or not to make politics in a region where everything is political\u201d.\nMore\n\nIn its relations with the European Union, Switzerland is playing a dangerous game of balancing, which could also come out losing.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

I have no memory of seeing such a population movement under such extreme conditions in recent history.\u201d\n\u201cIn addition to the offensive announced by Israel, the situation is extremely critical in Gaza,\u201d he said. Water supplies resumed last Sunday in southern Gaza, after being cut for seven days by the Israeli government. At the beginning of last week, he had ordered the stopping of the water, electricity and fuel supply of this territory which depends on its supply.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provided \u201cfuel at water distribution stations\u201d and \u201cestablished water reserves for some 250,000 people,\u201d said Fabrizio Carboni.\nDespite the Israeli government\u2019s order to move to Gaza, all populations did not leave the north of the Gaza Strip. But they must not become enemies, we must continue to protect them, said Fabrizio Carboni. \"There are hospitals, sick, elderly, people who don't want to let go of their homes. All these people are protected. They are entitled to receive the minimum vital to stay where they are. Even if they don't move, they don't suddenly become military objectives. \u00bb\n\"It must be very clear to everyone,\" he adds. I think we need to find spaces inside the Gaza Strip to protect these people.\u201d\nOn Thursday, the ICRC representative expressed his fear that \"without electricity, hospitals are turning into morgues,\" after having been in contact with health professionals on the spot and his colleagues in the Palestinian Red Crescent.\n\u201cI think we are in extreme situations where doctors try to do the best with what they have, but what they have is increasingly reduced. So unfortunately we move slowly towards this scenario,\" said Fabrizio Carboni.\nOn Tuesday evening, a hospital in the city of Gaza was hit by a strike that killed more than 500 people, according to Hamas, who accuses Israel of being at the origin of the attack. Tel Aviv denied all responsibility and attributed the raid to the Islamic Jihad. He denied his involvement.\nOn Monday, Fabrizio Carboni stressed the importance of ensuring free movement in the territory of the Gaza Strip to be able to meet the needs of the population. \u201cIt\u2019s no good to have food, water, medical logistics if you can\u2019t move inside. What we need is to be able to work in acceptable security conditions, which is not the case today.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to be able to urgently bring humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip,\u201d he said.\nNo humanitarian aid has been able to enter the Gaza Strip from Egypt by the Rafah border post, which was closed on Wednesday. Hundreds of trucks, including UN agencies, carrying food, water and medicines are waiting on the Egyptian side.\nAn Israeli land operation could have terrible consequences on the civilian population, fears the ICRC. \"With the experiences in Mosul (Irak) and Aleppo (Syria) in particular, it is well known that urban conflicts are devastating to the civilian population. They are extremely murderous, violent and have a devastating impact on the essential infrastructure: those to supply water and electricity are generally destroyed. So our first concern is the human cost of this military operation in urban areas,\" said Fabrizio Carboni.\nThe Battle of Mosul, which lasted from 2016 to 2017, reportedly caused the death of approximately 10,000 civilians and that of Aleppo, from 2012 to 2016, would have caused that of at least 21,500 civilians.\nIn order to protect the population, humanitarian actors, namely \"the Palestinian Red Crescent, the members of the Movement, the United Nations, all the organizations present, the local organizations\", act together,\" added Fabrizio Carboni.\nRegarding the Israeli hostages of Hamas, the Geneva organization said that it had confidential discussions with Hamas to request their release as soon as possible. \"They are at high risk and a great danger,\" said Fabrizio Carboni. On Saturday, all parties were contacted to ask them to ensure the safety of these people as soon as possible.\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t ask that they be treated well. But also that they contact their families and that they are released under no condition, he said. I think no one has been released so that is an indication of where we are in the discussions.\u201d\nMore\n\nIn its relations with the European Union, Switzerland is playing a dangerous game of balancing, which could also come out losing.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

But above all, he's dirty because we lied about him...\" insists investigative journalist Marie Maurisse. With Fran\u00e7ois Pilet in the Gotham City collective, they worked for several months to dig six white-collar crime files. Six stories of scams, drug traffickers, criminals, terrorists, who a priori have nothing in common. To one detail: all have passed by Swiss banks to whiten their dirty money.\nFrom this investigative work, they draw an unpublished podcast, co-produced by swissinfo.ch and Europe 1 Studio, which tells how Switzerland has become, over the decades, the \u201cunfortunate\u201d of scams from all over the world, far from the image we can have, once locked by bank secrecy.\nIn the first episode, direction New York in the early 20th century, where a certain Meyer Lansky grows, the man who a few years later will develop an innovative financial system to whiten the dirty money of the mafia, Cosa Nostra. Its connection with Switzerland: suitcase carriers, known as \"p\u00e8lerins\" that give it access to the backyard of a Swiss bank and its accounts that carry numbers, for more discretion.\n\u201cDangerous millions\u201d is a co-produced podcast by SWI swissinfo.ch, the online information service of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (a public media) and Europe 1 Studio, with Gotham City journalists.\nSeveral witnesses agreed to tell from the inside these cases, often unknown as we speak of millions and millions who have evaporated in nature. For example, former magistrate Carla Del Ponte testifies to his experience in Russia, in the footsteps of a public works company very close to power. Xavier Justo tells him his 547 days in detention in a prison in Asia, for having been involved in a huge case of embezzlement of public funds.\n\"The main difficulty in our work is the people on which we investigate and their lawyers, who have enormous means to make us fold,\" says Marie Maurisse. \"I don't see myself as a white knight or as a journalist without fear and reproach, who goes to denounce the wicked. The most important thing for me is transparency and public interest. Who are as important in a common law case as in a financial crimes case.\"\nMore\n\nImmigration is one of the solutions to the shortage of skilled labour.

The war in Ukraine, for example, and the issue of exports of war material from Swiss production have led to heated discussions both in Switzerland and abroad.\nIn the conflict between Israel and Palestine, Switzerland has made it clear that it considers Israeli settlements as illegal in international law. Now, in the current Israeli-Palestinian war, it was questioned why Switzerland is not talking about a terrorist organization at Hamas.\nOn Wednesday, the Swiss government declared that the militant group should be classified as a terrorist organization. A special working group will examine the legal possibilities for a ban on the organization.\nWhat would this Hamas classification be a terrorist organization? Is this the right way? Should neutral Switzerland become more active in conflict? We want to know about this from the community.\nWith the new offer \"dialog\", SRG offers you a thematic selection of contributions to the current armed conflicts and the role of Switzerland.

                "en_content": "The last Swiss women to get their political rights had to wait until 1990. It was then that the canton of Appenzell Inner Rhodes \u2013 where votes are still held in open-air assemblies \u2013 were forced by federal authorities to toe the legal line and allow women cast their votes at the regional level.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nWhile women in Switzerland were allowed to vote in 1971, those of canton Appenzell Inner Rhodes had to wait until 1990. \nAt the national level, Appenzeller women had already been voting for two decades, after the 1971 decision by Swiss men to give their female counterparts the vote. But by international comparison, even this privilege had come extremely late.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe risk of international reputational damage was another factor that brought an end to the Swiss resistance to giving women the vote 50 years ago. \nWhy did it take so long?\nOne factor was the widely-held belief that women were simply born for a non-political life: opponents of universal suffrage carried posters showing neglected children falling from their cots, insect-infested soothers, and barren, nagging young women. The fear was that if they entered politics, women would forget about their domestic and natural roles.\nSwiss men were not completely alone in holding such a belief.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland gave women the right to vote on February 7, 1971. The Alpine nation was one of the last to introduce women suffrage. \nFeminism in Switzerland did exist though. A Swiss women\u2019s movement -- \nwas created by Marie-Goegg Pouchoulin in 1868, in Geneva. Similarly, in 1886, on a lecture tour through the country, the writer Meta von Salis repeatedly denounced the unequal treatment of Swiss women. And in 1896 the first national women\u2019s congress was held in Geneva; voting rights were one of their core demands.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland gave women the vote in 1971 \u2013 one of the last countries in Europe to do so. \nWhile the First World War was a driver of the women\u2019s movement in other European countries \u2013 women demanded recognition for the work they had done while the men had fought \u2013 Swiss women were not likewise compensated. Efforts to push political equality at the cantonal level around this time also failed. The Second World War, which Switzerland again largely avoided, also did little to increase their prospects.\nIn 1957, when the government suggested that Swiss women should also carry out a form of obligatory military service, there was outrage. In one village, Unterb\u00e4ch in canton Valais, a protest vote made international headlines when a Swiss woman put a voting slip into the ballot box for the first time; it was later judged to be invalid.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nIn 1957, Swiss women voted for the first time in the village of Unterb\u00e4ch \u2013 against the wishes of the authorities and many local people. \nThe political system was also undoubtedly a factor in the slow progress. While in other countries women\u2019s suffrage had been introduced by elected parliamentarians, the Swiss system of direct democracy meant that privileged sections of the population had to voluntarily extend these privileges to new groups \u2013 debates around who gets to be part of \u201cthe people\u201d and vote continue to this day.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSince the creation of the Swiss federal state in 1848, the number of people gaining voting rights has risen steadily. \nSlowly, however, things began to move when individual towns began giving women the right to vote, then the cantons of Vaud, Neuch\u00e2tel and Geneva in 1959. In the 1960s a generation of activists emerged who were less inclined towards lobbying and more drawn to rebellion.\nIn Zurich, women\u2019s associations marked each anniversary of earlier failed attempts to secure the vote by burning torches, while younger women staged sit-down strikes and blocked traffic. In 1969, Swiss women from all generations marched on the capital Bern, where they demanded their participatory rights.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nAn hour of making noise in front of the Swiss parliament buildings was enough to find its way into the history books. \nThe year before this, the government had signed the European Convention on Human Rights \u2013 but with a clause to exclude women\u2019s political rights.

A new project modifying the functioning of both the first and second pillars, still with the aim of pushing back women\u2019s retirement, was again swept aside at the ballot box in 2017.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe revision of the old-age pension system accepted by the people on Sunday was only the first step. \nIt was not until September 2022 that the umpteenth revision of the OASI was finally accepted in a popular vote, with an increase in value-added tax (VAT) and the much talked-about increase in the retirement age for women from 64 to 65. A small revolution in Switzerland, while most industrialised countries have long since delayed retirement and abolished age differences between the sexes.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nLike in many industrialised countries, Switzerland is trying to align the age of retirement between men and women. \nThe increase in the retirement age for women in Switzerland is only the first step: there is still a long way to go before the entire system becomes sustainable. The revision of the OASI adopted by voters does not solve the financial problems of the old-age insurance system in the long term, nor does it reduce inequalities. A new reform of the first pillar is inevitable.\nA revision of the second pillar is underway, but it is generating a lot of criticism and is deeply dividing the parties on the left and right. Pensions will continue to be the subject of numerous debates and popular votes in the coming years.\nArticles in this story\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

In the early Middle Ages, a certain territorial or administrative unit could only\u00a0survive politically and economically\u00a0if it was protected by supreme authorities, in this case the\u00a0Holy\u00a0Roman Empire.\u00a0But\u00a0being an\u00a0inhospitable mountainous European region, Switzerland\u00a0could not\u00a0hope for\u00a0patronage or military support from the Empire as it had nothing to offer in return.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe\u00a0future cantons had\u00a0no other choice than\u00a0to join forces and defend and support each other\u00a0for\u00a0the lack of external protection from the Empire.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland doesn\u2019t take sides in a war. Thanks to its neutrality, it has been able to stay out of conflicts for a long time. \nThe\u00a0regions in central Switzerland as well as\u00a0the\u00a0canton\u00a0of\u00a0Bern, which historians often described as\u00a0\u201cSwiss Prussia\u201d, were at the core of the crystallisation of the confederation.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs the cantons\u00a0formed a defensive\u00a0as well as an economic alliance, Switzerland expanded beyond German-speaking Europe.\u00a0It conquered regions on the northern French-speaking shore of Lake Geneva\u00a0and\u00a0clashed with\u00a0the Grand Duchy of Burgundy.\u00a0Under the leadership of Charles the Bold of Burgundy, it\u00a0similarly strived to become one of Europe\u2019s great powers\u00a0at that\u00a0time.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nFrom time to time there is talk in Switzerland about creating larger cantons. Yet such ideas never seem to gain traction. \nThe\u00a0Burgundian Wars\u00a0(1474 \u2013 1477)\u00a0marked\u00a0the most important period in Swiss history. After\u00a0Switzerland\u2019s\u00a0victory, new regions\u00a0were conquered and\u00a0significant funds\u00a0that\u00a0formed the base\u00a0of prosperity\u00a0and power for Bern as well as the other regions of the Old Swiss Confederacy\u00a0were gained.\u00a0\u00a0\nAfter 1515, the\u00a0Reformation\u00a0triggered\u00a0permanent religious conflicts\u00a0in Switzerland,\u00a0which\u00a0culminated\u00a0in the\u00a0two\u00a0Wars\u00a0of Kappel (1529 and 1531)\u00a0as well as the\u00a0two\u00a0Wars\u00a0of\u00a0Villmergen\u00a0(1656 and 1712).\u00a0In between\u00a0these two conflicts,\u00a0a fifth war was waged. The\u00a0Swiss Peasant War of 1653\u00a0was\u00a0triggered by\u00a0the end of the Thirty Years\u2019 War\u00a0when Swiss\u00a0farmers,\u00a0who\u00a0were providing warring Germany with cereals,\u00a0suddenly\u00a0went\u00a0bankrupt.\u00a0\u00a0\nDuring these\u00a0terrible\u00a0conflicts,\u00a0Switzerland\u00a0turned away from the outside world. It\u00a0focussed on solving\u00a0its domestic conflicts\u00a0but still remained\u00a0an integral part of the western European economy.\u00a0As\u00a0the neutral country was\u00a0busy dealing with its\u00a0ongoing civil war, it\u00a0became a political island whose historic development has been following a\u00a0\u201cspecial\u00a0path\u201d\u00a0ever since.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe next\u00a0stage of Swiss history\u00a0is\u00a0characterised\u00a0by the introduction of\u00a0a\u00a0kind\u00a0of external governance in Switzerland.\u00a0The fate of the country was first determined by Napoleon and\u00a0later\u00a0by the European powers\u00a0during\u00a0the Congress\u00a0of Vienna. This period is\u00a0considered\u00a0one of the\u00a0most unpopular\u00a0chapters in Swiss national history.\u00a0The Swiss do\u00a0not like to admit that all necessary political and social reforms\u00a0were only\u00a0introduced\u00a0after\u00a0French revolutionary troops invaded\u00a0in 1798.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe neutrality so strongly associated with modern Switzerland originated in a congress 200 years ago, when the Great Powers met in Vienna. \nThis means that Switzerland owes\u00a0quite a few of its achievements to\u00a0the French:\u00a0equality\u00a0of\u00a0all before the law; equal rights for\u00a0rural and urban citizens; equality of all cantons\u00a0and the abolition of\u00a0dividing them\u00a0into\u00a0\u201coriginal old cantons\u201d, on the one hand,\u00a0and \u201ccolonies\u201d, on the other.\u00a0The Swiss\u00a0also\u00a0don\u2019t like to mention that the creation of\u00a0neutral post-Napoleon\u00a0Switzerland needed the permission of the European powers during the\u00a0Congress of\u00a0Vienna in 1815.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe\u00a0Congress of Vienna\u00a0was followed by a\u00a0second\u00a0permanent and\u00a0slow\u00a0civil war that lasted\u00a0for about\u00a020 years. In 1847, this war reached its\u00a0peak\u00a0with\u00a0the so-called\u00a0\u201cSonderbund\u00a0War\u201d against the Catholic church. This war put an end to\u00a0a series of\u00a0local political conflicts\u00a0between the\u00a0Protestant liberals and Catholic democrats. The Protestants\u00a0thought\u00a0that the people should be enlightened and educated in the rational spirit of Protestant ethics\u00a0and that the creation of a unified state was of utmost importance.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nMany people are surprised when they hear that little Bern is the Swiss capital. Wouldn't industrial Zurich or international Geneva be more logical? \nCatholics\u00a0believed\u00a0that people should live\u00a0as\u00a0they wanted\u00a0and should\u00a0have the freedom\u00a0to\u00a0believe in\u00a0their (Catholic) religion. They stressed the importance of having sovereign cantons. In the end, the Protestants won the\u00a0\u201cSonderbund\u00a0War\u201d\u00a0and created a new Swiss federal state based on French human rights, German philosophy of the rule of law and English utilitarianism.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nHere's how, in 1918, Switzerland made the historic decision to move to a proportional representation system at national level. \n1848 marked the beginning of a new stage\u00a0characterised by a high standard of living\u00a0which has continued\u00a0to this day.\u00a0This\u00a0consistent historic development has lasted for more than 170 years\u00a0without\u00a0any\u00a0dramatic breaks\u00a0\u2013 a phenomenon that has no\u00a0analogies in the history of Europe.\u00a0\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nOn June 14, 1991, half a million women in Switzerland joined the first women\u2019s strike. Nearly 30 years later, they\u2019re mobilising again. \nArticles in this story\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

                "en_title": "How neutral is Switzerland, really?",
                "en_content": "The war in Ukraine has reignited a debate about Swiss neutrality. A domestic debate about the definition and scope of neutrality has erupted, with two opposing camps. One is conservative, mainly represented by the rightwing Swiss People's Party, and wants to keep to a strict interpretation of neutrality. It is planning a people\u2019s initiative that would incorporate comprehensive neutrality into the Swiss constitution.\nThe opposing, more liberal camp, which represents a majority of the government, is pushing for active neutrality.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nHas Switzerland given up its neutrality? We asked Pascale Baeriswyl, head of the Swiss mission to the United Nations in New York. \nAt the end of May 2022, during the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos President Ignazio Cassis coined a new concept: \"cooperative neutrality\". This was his response to those who, asked how anyone could remain neutral in the face the Russian attack on Ukraine. Officials have announced they would publish a government report which, among other things, is intended to outline \"how our understanding of neutrality could develop further\".\nMore\n\n\n\n\nIs neutrality even possible in response to the invasion of Ukraine? And does strict neutrality have any benefits at all? \nThe debate is not new. For some time now, Switzerland \u2013 like most neutral states \u2013 has been moving away from a traditional concept of neutrality and towards the community of states: since it joined the United Nations in 2002, it has had to comply with UN sanctions.\nSwitzerland works on the basis that the law of neutrality does not apply to UN military missions because ultimately, the Security Council \n to maintain \u201cinternational peace and security\u201d.\nHowever, not everyone agrees. \u201cNeutrality in the classical sense is not really compatible with UN membership and even less so with EU membership\u201d, says Peter Hilpold, an Austrian international law expert at the University of Innsbruck.\nMore\nDebate\nNeutrality is in the dock. Does it have a future? And how should it be defined?\n\"Switzerland has at times clearly not been neutral,\" argues Stefanie Walter, a professor of international relations and political economy at the University of Zurich. \"In the Cold War, for example, Switzerland was implicitly clearly on the side of the West. And it also has a position on human rights.\"\nIn the Ukraine war, Switzerland immediately condemned the Russian attack on Ukraine as a violation of international law.\nThis raises the question of what, exactly, neutrality means. When the allies granted Switzerland perpetual neutrality at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the deal was that Switzerland would not take part in conflicts and would not provide mercenaries; in return, no more wars would be fought on its territory.\nThis principle has changed little over time; even today, the law of neutrality primarily obliges states not to participate in wars, either directly or indirectly. Neutral states must treat parties at war equally, i.e., they may not allow overflights or supply weapons to one side - even via third parties - and neglect to help the other side.\nIn recent months, Switzerland has banned NATO members from overflying because they were supplying Ukraine with weapons. And it refused to grant Germany and Denmark permission to give Ukraine tanks and ammunition bought from Switzerland. Pressure on Switzerland to back down from this strict stance is increasing abroad.\nNeutrality is not only a legal concept, but also affects Switzerland's image. Neutrality is an intrinsic part of Switzerland\u2019s identity, and it should not be jeopardized lightly. So while pursuing a voluntary and flexible \u201cneutrality policy,\u201d Switzerland is also trying to convince other countries that it would stand aside in the event of war.\nIn times of peace, Switzerland, as a neutral state, is not allowed to join a military alliance such as NATO, because it requires members to commit to mutual assistance.\nTraditionally neutral states such as Sweden and Finland applied to join NATO after the start of the Ukraine war \u2013 in legal terms, that equates to renouncing to their neutrality.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe war in Ukraine has reignited the debate in neutral countries about joining NATO. We spoke to a security expert. \nFor Switzerland, on the other hand, joining NATO is out of the question, despite the new era heralded by the Ukraine war. Switzerland is less exposed geographically than the two Scandinavian countries.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nCalls for more military cooperation are getting louder in Switzerland. How far can the country bend its traditional policy of neutrality? \nHowever, Switzerland and NATO do want to cooperate more closely in future, as agreed by the Swiss Defence Minister and the NATO Secretary General at a meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Even the Swiss population accepts this, according to a survey, despite its overwhelming support for neutrality and resistance to NATO membership.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nFor weeks SWI users from all over the world have been contributing to a debate on Ukraine and neutrality in ten languages. \nCloser cooperation is not in itself revolutionary, because Switzerland has been seeking closer military collaboration with its neighbouring countries and NATO for years, especially in the areas of training and cyber security. If Switzerland is attacked, it is of course allowed to defend itself in alliance with others; neutrality does not stand in the way of this.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nWith the backdrop of the Ukraine war, Swiss ambassador to NATO Philippe Brandt explains the importance of Switzerland's partnership with the alliance. \nSwitzerland follows a pragmatic approach. Because it is in the middle of Europe, it is unlikely that a military attack will be directed against Switzerland alone. It is much more likely that several European countries will be attacked at the same time and defend themselves together. If Switzerland participates in military exercises in peacetime and equips itself with compatible weapons systems, it will be in a position to fight alongside its Western friends in an emergency instead of having to defend itself alone. This is one of the reasons it has chosen US manufacturer Lockheed-Martin to manufacture its new F-35 fighter jet.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland is neutral. So why has it been cooperating with NATO and the EU on security issues for years? \nThis approach is often seen as freeloading from abroad. Although Switzerland wants to increase defence spending dramatically, it is still far from NATO\u2019s target, which requires members to invest 2% of GDP in defence.

Because it looks into the infrared, is much larger than the Hubble, and is not positioned in low orbit, the James Webb telescope is the most powerful astronomical instrument ever built by mankind. And among its builders, there are also Swiss.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwiss astrophysicist Adrian Glauser guides us through the technology in the most powerful space telescope ever deployed \u2013 the James Webb. \nThe announcement by the European Space Agency in December 2020 was a momentous one for the Swiss space community. The agency had agreed to allocate almost CHF100 million to ClearSpace-1, an initiative/start-up by Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) to clear space debris.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nIt is the first time the European Space Agency (ESA) has allocated such a large sum (\u20ac86 million) to a start-up. \nSwiss scientists and engineers have built their reputation in space exploration and research over many years.\nA discovery in 1995 made little noise outside scientific circles. But as the years passed, the public began to realise that what was once the realm of science fiction had become a proven reality: the galaxy is teaming not only with stars, but also with planets. The first to have identified one of these planets orbiting a star other than our sun were none other than Switzerland\u2019s own Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz. \u00a0\nAnd 24 years later, the discovery earned Mayor and Queloz the Nobel Prize for physics.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nJoint winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, Didier Queloz talks about waiting for the call from Sweden and how the award has changed his life. \nExcitement aside, the Nobel Prize is certainly justified. The discovery was one of the most important in astronomy in the 20th century. It opened new fields of research for understanding our place in the universe and it multiplied by millions the chances of finding extra-terrestrial life.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nOn October 6, 1995, Michel Mayor and Didier Qu\u00e9loz announced the discovery of the first planet orbiting a star other than our sun. \nBut the search for other lifeforms is not an easy task when we are looking for it on distant worlds that are hundreds of thousands of billons of kilometres away. This is where human ingeniousness intervenes. And here also, is where the Swiss are present.\nIngenuity was required from the very outset of this quest. But how is it, in fact, that we are sure of the existence of these planets when, apart from on one or two grainy photographs of vague spots of light, no one has ever seen them?\u00a0\nBut it might not be necessary to explore planets that far away. Bern-based scientists hope to find life in space using a state-of-the art instrument known as ORIGIN that may be used on future space missions to Jupiter and Saturn.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nScientists hope to find life in space using a state-of-the-art instrument that may be used on future space missions to Jupiter and Saturn. \nMore\n\n\n\n\nSince people first gazed up at the night sky, we have been asking ourselves what is up there. Today we know that billions of planets orbit billions... \nMeanwhile, research into exoplanets continues. Today scientists have the instruments and technology\u00a0to better understand what such distant planets are made of. This is the mission of the CHEOPS spatial telescope, the first European satellite \u2018Made in Switzerland\u2019 that was launched in December 2019.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nA Russian Soyuz rocket carrying the CHEOPS (Characterising ExOPlanets Satellite) telescope blasted off from Kourou, French Guiana. \nBut the Swiss reputation in space exploration was not established with CHEOPS, neither with Mayor and Queloz, nor even with the Swiss astronaut Claude Nicollier \u2013 first non-American mission specialist at NASA. \u00a0\u00a0\nIn 1969, Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the moon wearing Swiss watches on their wrists. And the first thing they did upon arrival, even before unfurling the star-spangled banner, was to install a solar sail from the University of Bern, itself being the only non-American scientific experiment on board Apollo 11.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe first manned mission to the moon was also one giant leap for the University of Bern, which helped to clear up a misconception about the Big Bang. \nSince the beginning of space exploration, there has hardly been an American or European mission which did not include Swiss technology. That\u2019s because this country knows how to make instruments which are both very precise and very reliable, indispensable attributes for responding to the constraints of a space voyage.\u00a0\nWhether it is propelling a rover on Mars, \u2018sniffing\u2019 the gas which escapes from a comet or taking high definition images of a planet in the solar system, Swiss engineers have the solution.\u00a0\nThe most recent example: STIX. This X-ray telescope will study solar eruptions from a European probe which will approach closer to the Sun than anything that has been attempted before.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe European-American Solar Orbiter probe took off from Florida on Sunday night with a Swiss X-ray telescope on board to study the Sun close up. \nSwitzerland, country of watchmaking and precision mechanics also has highly advanced education and research support systems, which explains in part how a small country in the mountains has become a big country in space.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWith its ten universities and two institutes of technology, Switzerland is at the forefront of research in many areas. \nArticles in this story\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

The largest animal-feed producer, the largest car-sharing company, and even parts of the public media in Switzerland are all organised as cooperatives.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe cooperative business model is a rare choice for Swiss entrepreneurs. SWI swissinfo.ch visits three start-ups that are bucking the trend. \nOnly in New Zealand do cooperative companies \n per 100 inhabitants than in Switzerland (figures from 2014). Migros alone employs almost 100,000 people: Switzerland's largest private employer produces everything from baby powder to breakfast rolls, which are then sold in supermarkets.\nBut what precisely distinguishes cooperatives from other companies? In cooperatives, the vote of each member counts equally. As in a political democracy, the principle of \u201cone person, one vote\u201d applies. By contrast, in limited companies, one person holding 51% of the shares has the majority voice.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nMartin Schl\u00e4pfer was once the face of Swiss retailer Migros in the halls of parliament. He reveals the secrets to successful lobbying. \nCooperatives, on the other hand, bring together members with a common practical or idealistic goal. Instead of being paid to outside investors, the profits of cooperatives flow back into the business or are distributed equally among members.\nMore\nDebate\nAt least 12% of the world's population are members of a cooperative - how about you? Share your experiences.\nIn some cooperative projects, such as the agricultural cooperatives of Longo Ma\u00ef founded in France in the 1970s, cooperative living encompasses all areas of life.\nCommunal life in the Freidorf (Free Village) near Basel was probably experimental in a similar way, at least in its first decades. Starting in the 1920s, managers and employees of today's supermarket chain Coop lived next door to each other. Altogether they occupied 150 houses. They shopped in the village-owned shop and saved together for their pensions. The cooperative concept permeated all aspects of their lives.\nThat way of life paid off: in the first few years, the inhabitants paid CHF850 ($906) to rent a house and received CHF200 from the profits of the cooperative shop.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nA hundred years ago a Swiss 'Free Village' was seen as a testing ground for an ideological third way between socialism and capitalism. \nTo this day, housing remains the purpose of many cooperatives. Today's housing cooperatives mainly guarantee low rents \u2013 only very few offer alternative forms of living together. Cooperatives contribute decisively to preserving affordable housing in sought-after urban areas, especially in expensive Zurich.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nFor residents of the Hunziker housing cooperative outside Zurich, sharing space and resources is more than efficiency \u2013 it is about community. \nMore\n\n\n\n\nMany of the cooperatives set up to alleviate the urban housing shortage following the First World War celebrate their 100th anniversary this year. \nIn terms of population, only two countries have more cooperative members than Switzerland. The ten largest cooperative companies alone accounted for more than 11% of gross domestic product in 2018. Switzerland is a country of cooperatives. And it always has been.\nA major Swiss newspaper, the \n, \n cooperatives the \"primordial soup of the Swiss economy\". In fact, they could also be declared the primordial soup of political life in Switzerland.\nThe Swiss Confederation, as Switzerland is officially called in German, hints at the idea of a nation of wills. Switzerland sees itself as a state united not by its linguistic or cultural singularity, but by the fusion itself. Beyond national myths, early cooperatives in many Swiss regions were precursors of the state.\nAround 700 years ago, pasture and forest land were jointly managed in so-called \u201ccooperative societies and corporations\". In some cases, farmers in the Middle Ages used land that had previously been without dominion; in others, noble families and monasteries handed over their land to such a cooperative for their use. The members' cattle grazed together. Work that needed doing was planned together.\nThese cooperatives marked the beginning of the political community: villages and municipalities developed out of them. The responsibilities of the cooperatives grew gradually, from water supply and justice to, eventually, care of the poor. In these cooperatives, people were living \"direct democracy in its purest form\", says historian Hans Stadler.\nBeginning in the 1830s, farmers, artisans and workers in Switzerland came together to form \"bread and fruit associations\". In the decades that followed, the Swiss cooperative movement developed in the wake of the international movement that had its origins in Rochdale, England. These pioneers believed they were following in the footsteps of Switzerland's older cooperative tradition. The \"cooperative\" has existed as a form of entreprise under Swiss law since 1881.\nIn 1895, participants from 13 countries launched international organisations of the political cooperative movement. Delegates from Switzerland travelled to the founding congress of the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) in London.\nIn Switzerland, cooperatives developed in the agricultural, banking, and construction sectors. Consumer cooperatives played an essential role in the economy, in addition to forming the backbone of the political cooperative movement.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nCooperatives are everywhere, but what\u2019s often forgotten is that they were once behind a global movement that advocated for world peace. \nAround 1900, the worldwide cooperative movement developed into a pacifist and internationalist force which, according to historian Rita Rhodes, managed to keep its distance from warring countries even during the First World War. Cooperative comes from cooperation. At the Cooperative Congress in Basel in 1921, the delegates of the League of Nations declared that the international organisation was pursuing the same goals as the cooperative movement.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nEvery year 30,000 Swiss choose to leave their homeland. A little known cooperative can help them with unforeseen challenges. \nFrom 1982 to 2013, the International Cooperative Alliance had its headquarters in Geneva. It is now based in Belgium.

Daniel Jositsch confirms that, the starting point of the inquiry stems from a\nof the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung (NZZ) on the Swiss financing of Palestinian non-governmental organizations (NGOs).\nIn July, the great Zurich daily published a detailed survey of Switzerland's commitment to the Palestinian territories and Israel, based in particular on a list of NGOs provided by the Federal Department for Foreign Affairs (DFAE) under the Transparency Act.\nAccording to the newspaper, Switzerland funds directly or indirectly more than 70 Palestinian organizations and projects. With the risk of financing NGOs that unilaterally take sides against Israel or express anti-Semitic opinions. In the list, three names are hidden, so as not to compromise the security of organizations or because their publication could harm \"the political interests of Switzerland\" (as the DFAE says to the NZZ).\nThe NZZ is\nin September on the issue of financing Palestinian NGOs. According to the daily newspaper, DFAE supports \"almost exclusively organizations that criticize Israeli policy - but almost none that blame the human rights situation in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, whose responsibility lies with Hamas and Fatah.\"\nIndirect support to organizations that support\nfor the boycott of Israel would be particularly problematic, although the government has always stated that the Confederation has never supported any campaign calling for the boycott of Israeli products.\nThe NZZ data and evaluations were questioned, inter alia, by\n. Switzerland would actually finance 25 Israeli NGOs and 33 Palestinians. Roland Dittli, a collaborator of the foundation, has\nin the columns of the weekly Wochenzeitung (Woz) to the accusations of unilateralism of Palestinian NGOs: \"The lists contain some of the largest Palestinian human rights organizations, known for their criticism,\" to the West Bank authorities and the Hamas government in Gaza.\nAnswering\nThe government declared at the end of September: \"In 2017, Switzerland provided financial support to 70 non-governmental organizations in the Near East. These include Palestinian, Israeli and third-country NGOs. A attribution to one of these categories is not always obvious and one may wonder if it is relevant.\"\nHowever, Switzerland's commitment to Israel and Palestine is the subject of great attention by Parliament. Seven parliamentary speeches on the subject were delivered at the September only session of the Federal Assembly. In addition to the questions of Daniel Jositsch, mention should be made of\nof the Liberal-radical National Councillor Hans-Ulrich Bigler requesting a report on the financing of Palestinian and Israeli NGOs, not to mention\nMember of Parliament for the Democratic Union of the Centre (UDC / conservative right) Maximilian Reimann, who asked for clarifications on the hidden names of the DFAE list.\nUDC National Councillor\nand the President of the CDP\nThey point to the Geneva Initiative, a peace proposal launched fifteen years ago by Micheline Calmy-Rey, then Swiss Foreign Minister, and which continues to benefit from the financial support of Switzerland.\nLast May, today's Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said that \"by supporting UNRWA (the United Nations organization for Palestinian refugees), we are maintaining the conflict alive\" in the Middle East, causing a great impetus. Subsequently, the Federal Council reiterated its support for the URBWA. Support again pointed out by the Liberal-radical MP\nand the UDC National Councillor\n.\nMore\n\nIn comparison to other countries, Switzerland is distinguished by its legendary stability. How does she explain?\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "en_content": "In front of an alternative bar in the city of Zurich stands the following panel: \u201cHere, racism is not tolerated, or sexism, even less homophobia or other form of discrimination.\u201d But the word \"anti-Semitism\", he does not appear in the list. Along this bar with its stroller, Amir Malcus is not quite surprised. \"Typique de la gauche\", comments this 37-year-old social worker.\nFor a long time activist on the left, he is now disappointed with his own political family. \"For me it is frustrating to see how anti-Semitism spread to the midst of the society where I put the most hope,\" he deplored.\nFor anti-Semitism bites the whole society, including on the left of the political chess. SWI swissinfo.ch interviewed some members of the Jewish community of Switzerland, history specialists, members of political circles and activists declaring themselves to the left, to know how they and they perceive this phenomenon.\nWhere Amir Malcus grew up in a remote valley of Switzerland, anti-Semitism was part of the furniture, he remembers. When he was a squatter, one day he had been able to try to deconstruct, among his squat comrades, some of the stereotypes related to the Jewish community. \u201cNo, not all Jews are rich,\u201d he had to explain. But when he ventured out of his valley, he realized that anti-Semitism was also widespread elsewhere.\nDuring meetings, he was regularly witnessing verbal slippages on Israel, without direct contact with them. \u201cI have heard phrases such as \u2018We will burn your country\u2019,\u201d he says. During demonstrations against the war in Iraq or the Economic Forum in Davos, Marcus said that he was disturbed by the use of cartoons to criticize capitalism but with anti-Semitic hints. Notably Judaophobic images where we see so-called \u201cmarionnetists\u201d pulling the strings of everything.\nMore\n\nThe use of anti-Semitic explanations during crises has lasted for centuries. Switzerland also has a long history in this area.\nIn 2016, a case had shaken the Swiss Socialist Youth in a campaign for a vote. To caricature a \u201cspeculator\u201d, a campaign poster filled it with stereotypes related to Jews: long nose, high-form, papillotes.\n\"Anti-Semitism is a chameleon,\" says Dina Wyler of the Foundation against Racism and Anti-Semitism (GRA). It always adapts to current accounts and often manifests itself through visual language or coded words, in order to remain 'presentable'. \u00bb\nIn Switzerland, the left tolerated the diatribes directed against the State of Israel well before what Marcus experienced in the 2000s. During the Second World War, then a schoolboy, the Zurich politician Emanuel Hurwitz was throwing stones and agonizing anti-Semitic insults. He remembered it until his last breath.\n\"Later, I was not confronted with such uncomplexed anti-Semitism in the left,\" he confessed to SWI swissinfo.ch at the end of his life. After his studies, he joined the ranks of the Swiss socialist party. Emanuel Hurwitz, elected in 1979 in the canton of Zurich, had remained faithful to the left. In the 1970s, he argued that the PS's position on the conflict in the Middle East was \"reflected.\"\nBut it had changed in 1982 with the beginning of the war in Lebanon. Israel suddenly appeared under the traits of the attacker. \u201cThis is when a form of hysteria took hold of the PS,\u201d he said. Elected from the left of Jewish confession, Emanuel Hurwitz was regularly invited to participate in round tables to evoke the subject.\nThese debates proved to be, he said, \u201cof pure propaganda for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)\u201d. He said he was struck by the Manichean arguments used. \u201cIsrael was then the absolute evil, while the PLO\u2019s position was approved in a general enthusiasm.\u201d\n\u201cThis hatred and fanaticism\u201d had surprised and decented him. A demonisation that was equivalent to a form of anti-Semitism. A professional psychiatrist, Emanuel Hurwitz tried to alert his own troops, explaining to his party comrades how the prejudices erupted could quickly rise to the surface in political situations.\nOn the left, many had made the deaf ear. On 1 May 1984, Emanuel Hurwitz had therefore decided to resign - both from the cantonal legislature and the socialist party - on the grounds that no debate on this issue had ever been held seriously. \"This long silence lasted 40 years,\" he explained.\nSince 2019, the Swiss PS and its cantonal sections have decided to adopt, as a definition of anti-Semitism, the one promulgated by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). And this definition includes anti-Semitism in connection with Israel. A \"tardive\" awareness told us Emanuel Hurwitz, stating, shortly before his death last February at 86, that this shift had a special taste for him.\nA long-standing friendship had linked Emanuel Hurwitz to Berthold Rothschild, another Zurich politician, but who had joined the Swiss Labour Party, communist obedience, in the 1980s. According to the latter, the communists have long considered Israel to be a \u201cheroic nation\u201d, because of the way that this state has built itself. \"Then everything has shifted,\" he analyses. Shortly before he deserted the ranks of his party, he assured that he had observed a resurgence of stereotypes in his political family. It was said, for example, that members of the Jewish community tended to betray the left.\nThe war in the Middle East then obviously shook it, generating internal dilemmas. Among his comrades, several were \"a blinded by the hatred of the Jew, such as Lebanese Hezbollah or the Palestinian Hamas movement would speak to it,\" he explained. Berthold Rothschild didn\u2019t hold it to them, even though he had sometimes left meetings after hearing offensive remarks. From its point of view, Israel's policy and the fate of the Palestinian-nes inevitably indign as much to the left. \u201cA often justified indignation,\u201d he says.\nHe takes the example of one of his friends, who was engaged on the ground in the Middle East where she helped the people of Gaza. \"I understand that one becomes a propalestinian when one lives such a situation on a daily basis,\" he says. But Berthold Rothschild adds as soon as it can also lead to \"an anti-Israeli position at the limit of fanaticism\". \"Being anti-Israeli does not mean being anti-Semitic, but the red line is fine,\" he warns. For him, anti-Semitism is a repressed theme on the left.\n\u201cIn order to avoid potential disrapies, activists and activists should keep an eye out for every moment,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I am aware that society can transmit its racist hints to me, I hope that at least others are as conscious of it.\u201d Among his comrades on the left, several of them do not hesitate to submit flyers or political programmes before printing to him to find out if, according to his expertise, these texts might induce some prejudices. \"Exemptions,\" he said.\nFor Erik Petry, Deputy Director of the Centre for Jewish Studies at the University of Basel, \"it is necessary to gauge each situation on a case-by-case basis\". But \u201ca toxic mixture can appear, he says, if we do not objectively criticize Israel\u2019s policy and if we emit the hypothesis that immoral behaviors have a direct connection to Judaity.\u201d The left has produced some examples.\nBut in these conditions, the right has beautiful game of fustiger the anti-Semitism of the left, nuance Christina Sp\u00e4ti. Professor of History at the University of Freiburg, she believes that the right also attempts to \u201cwash hands\u201d with all anti-Semitism. However, she confirms, a left-wing anti-Semitism exists.\nThere is also a thesis: \"The Swiss left and Israel - Enthusiasm for Israel, anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism between 1967 and 1991\". The academic has identified and classified articles and incidents highlighting the existence of anti-Semitic resentments in the left-wing circles at that time.\nIn 1970, for example, the socialist press had published a comment fustigating the capture of Nazi Adolf Eichmann by an Israeli commando sent to Argentina, calling it \"gifle to the face of Argentina\". In the 1980s, a large newspaper of the Helvetic left had compared Israel's \"final solution\" policy, which had led millions of Jews and Jews to extermination.\nChristina Sp\u00e4ti has compiled other examples in this sense. At the time, the commentary on the capture of Adolf Eichmann had certainly caused a toll because of his primary anti-Semitism, but other articles written more subtly were, they, passed to the back of the net\u2019s stitches. The historian argues that \u201cthe left would have squeezed a form of indifference about anti-Semitism\u201d. Germany began reflection in the 1990s but without real effect in Switzerland, she told SWI swissinfo.ch.\nFarouchement opposed to any anti-Semitism, a left-wing activist has yet narrated to us how, in the 1990s, her policies threatened her to \u201cshoot her in the knee\u201d at a briefing session in Zurich, she said that the subject was rather clivant. Or that in the early 2000s, a text and a cartoon on the Indymedia platform had triggered a fierce debate on the left. A criminal complaint had been filed, but Indymedia Switzerland had not withdrawn the doubtful content, while its owners had ruled the anti-Semitic nature. For some years, Christina Sp\u00e4ti has noted the change in left circles in Switzerland, in particular the desire to die.\nIn this \"dynamics of climbing\", friendships broke, according to the Zurich left newspaper Wochenzeitung (WOZ). In particular, the WoZ had quoted the words of a left-wing political leader, who claimed that racism could \u201cin principle not be combated by State instruments\u201d, like the anti-racist criminal standard. A position that no one on the left would publicly express twenty years later. In recent years, feminist and anti-racist movements have made widespread awareness of discrimination.\n\nSign up for our free newsletter and receive our best items in your mailbox.\nBut nothing says that hints of anti-Semitism do not go up to the surface, also to the left, according to well-known patterns. This is at least what emerges from echoes that we gathered from young Jewish activists in Switzerland. Interviewed by SWI swissinfo.ch, Anna Rosenwasser, a young 30-year-old half-Jewish, is active on social networks. \u201cI\u2019m concerned with anti-Semitism... and not just half,\u201d she said. On Instagram, where it is positioned on voting themes related to feminist and queer causes, about 25,000 people follow it regularly today.\nAnna Rosenwasser considers that the anti-Semitism of the left is not the most threatening. For her, the level of requirement is higher on the left. \"It is clear to me that the left needs a conscious approach to anti-Semitism,\" she said. Anti-Semitic patterns of thought are widespread in our society. To know and think about them is an important antifascist mission in my eyes.\"\nA member of the Swiss Foundation against Racism and Anti-Semitism, Dina Wyler has a lot in this direction. According to her, many people still believe that the Jewish community enjoys privileges and cannot therefore be discriminated against. \"On the left also, they are denied this experience of discrimination,\" she concludes.\nArticles mentioned\nAnti-Semitism Series in Switzerland\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

The number of injuries per thousand and the damage to infrastructure is enormous, especially in the Gaza Strip.\nWhile the fighting was still raging, the Jewish organizations in Switzerland reiterated their demand to classify Hamas among terrorist organizations. In one\nthe Swiss Federation of Israel\u2019s Communities (FSCI) and the Swiss Liberal Jewish Platform (PJLS) present Hamas as \u201clightly extremist, terrorist and anti-Semitic\u201d and are indignant that in Switzerland, \u201cHamas is going and comes at its own discretion, collecting donations and going to its financial operations\u201d. The two organisations \u201crequire\u201d from Switzerland, therefore, that they see their position again. The Israeli embassy in Bern asked for the same thing.\nThe claim is not new: in 2017, the national advisor UDC (preservative right) Christian Imark had\nthe Federal Council to prohibit or classify Hamas among terrorist organizations. After the recent escalation, the soothing elect told us that, according to him, \u201cthis ranking would always be correct, especially because Hamas appears again as an attacker and uses its own population as a human shield\u201d.\nIn fact, Switzerland has so far declared only Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (Daesh) as terrorist organizations. This means that direct discussions are impossible between them and the Helvetic government. And that is also why the Federal Council never wanted to access the Hamas demand. As part of its peace policy in the region, it is important to speak to all actors and to be able to offer the good offices of Switzerland. Both between Israel and the Palestinians and the inter-Palestinian dialogue between Islamic Hamas and the lay Fatah.\nRecent episodes of violence have not changed anything. \"The DFAE took note of FSCI's request. The position of Switzerland [...] remains valid. Hamas denies the right to Israel\u2019s existence and defends the armed struggle as a legitimate means of resistance. Switzerland condemns these positions very clearly,\" the Department of Foreign Affairs tells us.\nAnd to recall that Switzerland was in contact with all parties in conflict and also called on Hamas in Gaza to end all acts of violence and respect humanitarian and human rights law.\nThere are several reasons why the European Union has not played a major role in negotiating the ceasefire. Having classified Hamas as a terrorist organization, the EU cannot lead direct discussions with it \u2013 which is also the case for many other states. Some consider it terrorist only the Hamas military branch, not the organization as a whole.\nAfter the violence in recent weeks, the pressure to classify Hamas as a terrorist movement has risen in several countries. The candidate for the German Federal Chancellery, Christian Democrat Armin Laschet, asks, for example, that the Hamas flag be banned, while others call for the total ban of the organization.\nThe question is, however, how productive a ban would be. According to analysts, Hamas became the most important political force for Palestinians. Beyond the Gaza Strip, which he has been leading since 2007, he is gaining more and more support in the West Bank and among the Israeli Arabs. In an interview\n, the expert from the Near East Erich Gysling summed up the dilemma: \"Hamas is the political winner on the Palestinian side. We have to keep talking to him. Ranking him as a terrorist does not help anyone.\u201d\nMore\nDiscussion\nSwitzerland refuses to consider Hamas as a terrorist organization. Is it cowardice or intelligence?\nMore\n\nIn its relations with the European Union, Switzerland is playing a dangerous game of balancing, which could also come out losing.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "en_content": "As a result of Hamas\u2019 attacks in Israel, the Swiss government is considering calling the Palestinian militant group as a terrorist organization, as the European Union, Canada and the United States have done. swissinfo.ch met with Riccardo Bocco, professor emeritus at the Institute of High International Studies and Development (IHEID) in Geneva, to understand what it would mean for Switzerland and what role the country could play in a peace process.\nRiccardo Bocco: Switzerland's previous dialogue with Hamas has enabled the country to play an effective mediator in the conflicts and negotiations that have passed because of its neutrality. The desire to describe Hamas as a terrorist organization is in contradiction with the historical neutrality of Switzerland and its role as a mediator. This may impair its ability to navigate and serve as a mediator in future regional conflicts and negotiations, such as the release of hostages or the facilitation of dialogue between parties in conflict.\nSwitzerland should take advantage of its tradition of neutrality and play an intermediary role without taking the party of Israel or Palestine. It is possible to recognize that both parties have committed war crimes, taking into account the actions of Hamas and Israel\u2019s response. Switzerland can provide valuable service by cautioning against a potential intensification of hostilities, such as Israel\u2019s land invasion in Gaza, underlining the risk of an increase in war crimes. But to do so, the Swiss Ministry of Foreign Affairs must have the necessary strength and determination, which is of concern given its apparent weakness.\nAfter the Oslo Accords in 1993 (signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization), Switzerland set up a group of diplomats who effectively committed themselves to Palestine. Today, this political will no longer exists. Swiss diplomats are less numerous and less well prepared. This poses an important problem for the diplomatic efforts of Switzerland in the region.\nThe Gaza population exceeds two million and the vast majority are refugees who benefit from the assistance of UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East). An organization that partly finances Switzerland. It should therefore strongly support UNRWA, which is the only United Nations agency to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinian refugees. It is important to note that the more than six million Palestinian refugees in the region do not enjoy any legal protection from any agency, which makes them particularly vulnerable worldwide.\nUNHCR (Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) and UNRWA both deal with refugees, but have separate mandates and areas of intervention, particularly with regard to Palestinians and Palestinians:\nAt the diplomatic level, if Switzerland reduces its humanitarian assistance, it is equivalent to a \"suicide\". On what basis would it stop humanitarian aid? The allegations that Hamas would divert the aid money are not verified. The allocation of international assistance to Gaza has become a sophisticated mechanism, which guarantees in-depth controls over the beneficiaries and expenses of the funds. The European Union, which provides significant financial assistance, uses a specific mechanism, called PEGASE, to ensure that funds reach the associations and institutions concerned. Therefore, even if financial mismanagement may exist, any allegation must be supported by clear examples rather than propagating unaudited statements.\nToday, a two-State solution seems unpleasant. The current Israeli logic is that of one State. On the legal level, Israel has developed, within its administration of the occupied territories, laws that discriminate, separate and move the Palestinian people. The issue of racial discrimination in Israel has been increasingly highlighted since 2017, when the United Nations issued a report accusing Israel of apartheid towards the Palestinian population.\nThe failure of the two-State solution, illustrated by the difficulties of the Geneva Initiative (an initiative brought by Israeli and Palestinian civil societies launched in 2003), suggests that alternative solutions, such as a federalist model, should be considered. The exploration of new models of peacebuilding, such as federalism, depends largely on the willingness of the parties concerned to exceed established political and territorial positions. This complex and multifaceted issue requires international and local engagement.\nMore\n\nIn its relations with the European Union, Switzerland is playing a dangerous game of balancing, which could also come out losing.\nVarious Palestinian and Israeli organizations explore alternative models. This includes the \u201csolution of a single democratic State\u201d, a \u201cbinational State\u201d and a \u201cfederation\u201d. However, it is currently difficult to discuss these options in detail and move towards one of them because of the ongoing war. It is essential to wait for its outcome to explore further these options.\nThis is the legal and constitutional architecture of the state. Israel, which is defined as a Jewish democratic state without full constitution, navigates between delicate religious and political balances. A \u201cUniitarian democratic state\u201d would require equal status for all citizens of Jewish and Palestinian origin, and a defined constitution guaranteeing equal rights. On the other hand, a \u201cbinational state\u201d could offer different political structures to the two national groups, but it must be carefully planned to avoid internal conflicts and ensure equitable representation and rights for all. The exploration of these models requires careful consideration of the various religious and political perspectives in the region.\nA \u201cbinational state\u201d implies recognition of the right to self-determination for the Israeli and Palestinian Jewish people. In its 2018 National State Bill, Israel stated that only Jewish Israelis and Israelis had the right to self-determination. But this right was essential in decolonization in other regions such as Africa and India.\n\n\n\n\nThe opinion of the former Swiss Foreign Minister on Swiss neutrality in the face of war in Ukraine.\nLooking at past efforts, such as those that followed the Oslo Accords, there is an important lesson on the need to strictly enforce and respect international law in peacebuilding processes. Despite the agreements, actions such as the confiscation of land by Israel after 1994 took place without intervention or significant international consequences. Europe and the United States have not ensured that the parties concerned strictly respect international law and standards. It is essential to hold the parties responsible for their actions. States must respect legal and ethical standards and not allow their geopolitical or diplomatic relations to temper their legal and fair practices requirements in the context of the resolution of international conflicts.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

Also in Switzerland. This global debate is a point for the future. This is nothing less than democracy, human rights, emancipation and education.\nThat is why we are convinced that this topic deserves our attention and your attention.\nTogether with you, we would like to focus on the topic of freedom of expression and encourage exchange across Swiss borders. This newsletter gives you an overview of our article series, which we have published in the past three months and which we will compile for you again. Read below or discuss with us:\nMore\nDebates\nFreedom of expression is a universal human right. But this is more and more under pressure. Also in confessed democracies. Some reasons...\nWe are aware that we send this newsletter comfortably from Switzerland. In Switzerland freedom of expression is a legally protected property. In principle, no one can be prevented from expressing their opinion. Nevertheless, it becomes obvious that the limits of free expression of opinion lie. Freedom of expression is also under pressure in other democracies.\nWe're on a critical route. Today, 68% of the world's population live in 87 countries in autocratic regimes. Read our analysis of Yanina Welp, researcher at the Albert Hirschman Centre on Democracy in Geneva. It describes the disturbing tendency that leading industrial nations of the G20 such as India or Brazil belong to those countries where democracy decreases. And it is also amazing that there is a European country at the top of autocratisation: Poland.\n\n\n\n\nFreedom of expression is at a critical path: In many countries it is threatened, and in others its borders are extinct.\nThe increase in populism is, according to Welp, a symptom of exhaustion. This comes from structural inequalities in many countries and, like a growing racism, as a valve for this inequality.\nAnother article that highlights the restrictions on freedom of expression worldwide is the focus of our democracy expert Bruno Kaufmann:\nMore\n\nA cornerstone of democracy is blurring. Who protects freedom of expression? Our updated overview.\nIn Switzerland, the Federal Council held strong interventions in fundamental rights during Corona. Switzerland, suddenly a dictatorship? The grotesque debate dominated the Polit Spring in Switzerland. Our democracy specialist Renat Kuenzi explains,\n.\nParliament transferred the emergency measures to ordinary law \u2013 the so-called Covid-19 Act. In mid-June, the Swiss voters were now able to comment. This is a globally unique direct democratic process for corona politics: well 60% endorsed the new law.\n\"In Switzerland, citizens are repeatedly making binding decisions on freedom of expression. A challenging hike\", as Bruno Kaufmann writes.\nAnd where is it currently in danger?\nNot only is the Corona pandemic a great challenge for freedom of expression: fake news, hatred and discrimination on the net.\n\nShould private companies be responsible for controlling unacceptable speech? And where are the boundaries between hate speech and free speech.\n.\nMore\n\nSign up for our newsletter and receive swissinfo.ch's top stories directly in your mailbox.\n: Around 30 non-governmental organizations warn against these legal attacks, which threaten freedom of expression in Switzerland. Samuel Jaberg reports.\n\"\n: David Eugster looks at the recent past.\n: For the first time in 2019, more people have lived under an autocratic regime for almost two decades than in a democracy, writes Claude Longchamp.\nInequality and racism are the driving force for the rise of populist leaders throughout the world. Social division threatens democracy. The standpoint from the International Geneva is entitled \"\n\".\nWithin society is intensively negotiated over the limits of the Sagable. Pros: People who had hardly one voice before will be heard. Their freedom of speech became greater, others feel that their freedom of expression was severely restricted.\n\nWhat should be said and what should not be said is increasingly triggering uncertainty in practice \u2013 and hardly anything can be instrumentalized politically as simply as this uncertainty. The \"Freedom of Thought\" like the \"Political Correction\" has long since become a political concept. This does not simplify the discussion, but splits society and creates potential for usability and radicalization.\nStay tuned, get your hearing and discuss\nwith us. For if a dominant opinion cannot be questioned, there is no democracy.\nWith cordial greetings from summer Bern,\nLarissa M. Bieler\nMore\n\n\n\n\nFreedom of expression is a human right, and yet everything else than a matter of course.\nArticles in this story\nSet voices of freedom from all over the world\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "en_content": "The storm on the US Capitol on the 6th January was a shock.\nFired by the elected president, a Mob tried to prevent the official confirmation of successor Joe Biden.\nThe following closures of the accounts of the selected US president by tech giants Twitter, Facebook and Youtube made clear: Control of freedom of expression has become a major issue of power.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nLarge online platforms address freedom of expression in democracies. Digital expert Martin Steiger has possible solutions.\nAt the game there is nothing less than the future of democracy, said Dirk Helbing, Professor of Computational Social Science at ETH Zurich, at the Swiss online magazine\n: \"If pluralistic civil society does not win the upper hand, it is over with democracy. We must solve our problems with an idea competition, not with violence or totalitarian measures.\"\nHow could it come? In 1996, the US Congress adopted a supplement to the so-called \"First Amendment\" of the US Constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression. \"Section 230\" (\"Section 230\") of the \"Communications Decency Act\" secures the large Tech Group immunity for all content that users publish on their online platforms. In short, it is a disclaimer of liability.\nThis opened the Pandora's box for the uninhibited publication of content of all kinds on the Internet, says Swiss tech journalist Adrienne Fichter, who specializes in network policy topics.\nIs the key to a solution \u2013 and so we are back in the present \u2013 that is, \"an amendment or deletion of this \"persilschein\"?\nYes, says American Stephen Hill, former director of the Center for Humane Technology and author. It is time for a restart, he writes in a\non the online publication Zocalo Public Square.\nThe abolition of the \"obscure law\" by the Congress did not have a perfect solution. \"But it would make Big Tech Media more responsible, thoughtful and potentially liable for the worst of their toxic content, including illegal content such as child pornography,\" said Hill.\nHe pleads that the U.S. government takes the digital group to the Kandare, as it had done with the telephone, railway and energy companies. In concrete terms, he calls for the following steps:\nThis is exactly where Marietje Schaake sees need for action.\n\"Tech companies are too powerful, especially the handful of huge players who run social media platforms and search engines,\" says the President of the Cyber Peace Institute in Geneva and Director of International Politics at Stanford University's Cyber Policy Center.\nSWI #Freedom of Thought Series\nIn principle, everything should be clear. Both in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and in the UN Act on Civil and Political Rights (1966), Article 19 states: \"Everyone and everyone has the right to free expression of opinion; this right implies freedom to seek, receive and disseminate information and thoughts of any kind, whether oral, written or printed, by art or by another medium of its choice.\"\nIn Europe, the European Human Rights Convention (1950) confirms freedom of expression as legally binding law (Article 10). Switzerland anchors this fundamental freedom in Article 16 of its 1999 constitution.\nIn practice, however, much remains controversial. Governments around the world do not protect the right to freedom of expression, but increasingly undermine it. In other parts of the world, individuals and groups use the term \"freedom of opinion\" to justify discriminatory and hateful externalities. But although it is a universal right, freedom of expression is not an absolute right. To ensure and apply them is always a ridge hike.\nIn a new series, SWI swissinfo.ch deals with these different aspects, challenges, opinions and developments relating to freedom of expression \u2013 both in Switzerland and worldwide.\nWe offer a platform for citizens to look at the topic, provide analyses from renowned scientists and illuminate developments at local and global level. And of course, readers are invited to participate in the discussion and raise their voice this spring.\n\"They are not only able to move masses of consumers, but also masses of voters. This power must now be addressed,\" says Schaake\n*. The Dutch also advocates regulation analogous to that of banks, pharmaceutical companies or the automotive industry.\n\"On the one hand, it takes clear commitments and standards from companies. On the other hand, serious sanctions must be imposed on violations of supervisory bodies and regulatory authorities. These bodies must have both the know-how and the power and the capacity to carry out such measures and to investigate what is going on.\"\nUnlike Hill holds Claire Wardle from\n, a global initiative against disinformation, not much of a deletion of paragraphs with the exclusion of liability. \"Without such protection, platforms could be forced to remove both true and false information,\" says Wardle to SWI swissinfo.ch. \"Instead of focusing on the elimination of false information, we should think more about why people even publish and disseminate such.\"\nAccording to Wardle, the state should promote a \"heavy news environment\" by supporting local providers. \"As local news providers are dying, more and more people are in the social media to provide messages there.\"\nWardle considers a global solution to be possible. \"The UN has set standards to protect freedom of expression, on which many platforms are oriented. Thus, a mechanism for global corporate accountability could also be possible.\"\nAt the end of 2020, the European Commission \u2013 the EU executive \u2013 has presented the \"Digital Services Act\" with which the global tech giants are to become more responsible. The principle of the draft: What is prohibited in the real world should also be in cyberspace bans.\nFor digital specialist Adrienne Fichter, this focuses on a innovation: \"The law bred a uniform action along defined and institutional procedures. With points of contact, binding deadlines and the possibility of proceeding to state courts.\"\nFichter points out, however, that Google has already announced bitter resistance to the regulatory plan.\nIn fact, they saw themselves confronted with the conquered resistance of 27 states. In addition, according to the hope of Brussels, the EU regulatory framework would be the new benchmark that other countries would have to follow.\nLike most countries, the Swiss government has so far set on self-regulation. But there's also something in Bundesbern. \"The Federal Administration is currently declaring how a Swiss governance approach is necessary and possible with regard to online platforms,\" writes the Federal Office for Communication (Bakom) on request from SWI swissinfo.ch.\nBased on a 2019 report, the authorities were now currently examining how the use of artificial intelligence or algorithms by search engines or social media would influence public opinion and will formation. However, the publication of the corresponding report should be expected at the earliest at the end of this year, according to the Bakom.\nThe Swiss authorities would closely monitor the legislative process in the EU in the field of digital services. However, it is too early to assess how relevant the regulation proposed by Brussels could be for Switzerland.\nAfter all, the Bakom reveals so much: in the forthcoming report, not \"in the first place, the need to align Swiss law with EU law, but a Swiss governance approach\" would be examined.\nMovement also exists in the Swiss Parliament. National Council of Balthasar Gl\u00e4ttli submitted a motion that calls for an international online platform in Switzerland. \"My advance would be relevant to Swiss people who feel that they are illegally locked, but they do not pass on via the usual reporting mechanisms online,\" says Gl\u00e4ttli.\nThis was also true for people from Switzerland who want to fight against racist vaccinations or personal injury.\nFor Martin Steiger, a specialist in law in digital space, Gl\u00e4ttlis's proposal goes in the right direction, as it is in a\nwith swissinfo.ch said, \"If you had such a 'letter box' here, affected people could get hurt faster.\" National and postulate have adopted the motion, now the Federal Council is on the train.\nGl\u00e4ttlis Ratskollege Jon Pult asks the Federal Council to provide information on political advertising on the Internet in an advance of last December. He also wants to know whether the government sees any need for regulation of personalised campaigns.\nArticles in this story\nSet voices of freedom from all over the world\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                    "\"F\u00fcr die Demokratie ist die Meinungsfreiheit und auch die Informationsfreiheit wesentlich\", sagt Hertig. Das Gleiche gelte f\u00fcr die Forschung: \"Fortschritt ist nur m\u00f6glich, wenn die vorherrschende Meinung in Frage gestellt werden kann.\"",

                    "In der Praxis bleibt jedoch vieles umstritten. Regierungen auf der ganzen Welt sch\u00fctzen das Recht auf freie Meinungs\u00e4usserung nicht, sondern unterminieren es zunehmend. In anderen Teilen der Welt nutzen Einzelne und Gruppen den Begriff \"Meinungsfreiheit\", um diskriminierende und hasserf\u00fcllte \u00c4usserungen zu rechtfertigen. Doch obwohl sie ein universelles Recht ist, ist die Meinungsfreiheit kein absolutes Recht. Sie zu gew\u00e4hrleisten und anzuwenden, ist immer eine Gratwanderung.",

Hierzu sagt Maya Hertig: \"Wer eine kontroverse Meinung \u00e4ussert, muss auch zugespitzte Meinungen der Gegenseite aushalten. Es geh\u00f6rt dazu, dass man dann rhetorisch angegriffen wird. Es gibt kein Recht, nicht kritisiert zu werden.\"",

Versuchen Sie, den Sinn und Zweck des Impfens in Frage zu stellen. Es kann sein, dass Sie so aggressiven Gegenwind ernten, dass Sie beim n\u00e4chsten Mal lieber stumm bleiben.\" Anders zu denken sei sozial ge\u00e4chtet und Meinungsfreiheit damit de facto nicht m\u00f6glich.",

                    "\"Shitstorms\" k\u00f6nnen da laut Hertig ebenfalls ein Problem darstellen.

So kommt es durch Bestrafung, N\u00f6rgeln, Liebes- oder Freundschaftsentzug oder durch das Erzeugen eines schlechten Gewissens bei den \"kontrollierten\" Personen zu Scham oder \u00c4rger.",
                    "In Studien zu sozialer Kontrolle in Bezug auf das Gesundheitsverhalten bei Paaren fanden Scholz und ihr Team heraus, dass diese negativen Strategien wenig bringen. Sie konnten keinen Zusammenhang feststellen zwischen \"negativer\" sozialer Kontrolle und einem ges\u00fcnderen Verhalten. Im Gegenteil: Die kontrollierten Personen machten h\u00e4ufig gerade nicht das, was ihre Partner erwarteten \u2013 entweder demonstrativ oder heimlich.",
                    "Anders reagierten jene Personen, die mit positiven Strategien der sozialen Kontrolle konfrontiert waren. Zu den positiven Strategien geh\u00f6ren Diskutieren, Verhandeln, \u00dcberreden, das Aufzeigen von Vorteilen des angestrebten Verhaltens, der Verweis auf positive Beispiele und Komplimente. \u00dcbte der Partner solche positiv erlebte soziale Kontrolle aus, \u00e4nderten die \"kontrollierten\" Personen ihr Verhalten eher und f\u00fchlten sich besser.",
                    "Negative soziale Kontrolle, wie sie gegenw\u00e4rtig in der \u00d6ffentlichkeit zum Beispiel durch b\u00f6se Blicke oder schroffes Zurechtweisen vorkommt, sei zwar in einer Pandemie nicht un\u00fcblich. Doch: \"Unter Umst\u00e4nden reagieren manche Menschen dann eben gegenteilig: Sie sehen eine Diktatur am Werk und weigern sich, die Massnahmen einzuhalten.\" Diese Menschen f\u00fchlten sich bevormundet, widersetzten sich und versuchten, ihre Autonomie wiederherzustellen.",
                    "Die Forschungsresultate von Urte Scholz zeigen: Positive Strategien sozialer Kontrolle w\u00e4re auch w\u00e4hrend der Pandemie w\u00fcnschenswert. Das hiesse: Mit Kritikern der Schutzmassnahmen in Dialog treten, sich austauschen, andere Meinungen zulassen und ein Verhalten nicht \u00fcber Druck oder negative Emotionen \u00e4ndern wollen.",
                    "Wenn jemand ohne Maske im Tram sitzt, k\u00f6nnte man zum Beispiel sagen: \"F\u00fcr mich w\u00e4re es wichtig, dass Sie eine Maske tragen, weil ich mich dann wohler f\u00fchle.\" Oder: \"Sie haben die Maske bestimmt vergessen, das ist mir auch schon passiert.\" Oder dem anderen eine frische Maske anbieten.",
                    "Sind solche Versuche nicht naiv und zum Scheitern verurteilt? \"Ob das Gegen\u00fcber auf ein solches Angebot eingeht, h\u00e4ngt stark vom sozialen Kontext ab\", sagt Scholz.

                "en_content": "\"Freedom of expression protects a fundamental need for people,\" says Maya Hertig, professor of Swiss and European constitutional law at the University of Geneva. The idea of freedom of expression is based on the enlightened concept that we are all thinking, reasonable beings that form their opinion in dialogue.\n\"Freedom of expression and freedom of information are essential for democracy,\" says Hertig. The same applies to research: \"Progress is only possible if the prevailing opinion can be challenged.\"\nSWI #Freedom of Thought Series\nIn principle, everything should be clear. Both in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and in the UN Act on Civil and Political Rights (1966), Article 19 states: \"Everyone and everyone has the right to free expression of opinion; this right implies freedom to seek, receive and disseminate information and thoughts of any kind, whether oral, written or printed, by art or by another medium of its choice.\"\nIn Europe, the European Human Rights Convention (1950) confirms freedom of expression as legally binding law (Article 10). Switzerland anchors this fundamental freedom in Article 16 of its 1999 constitution.\nIn practice, however, much remains controversial. Governments around the world do not protect the right to freedom of expression, but increasingly undermine it. In other parts of the world, individuals and groups use the term \"freedom of opinion\" to justify discriminatory and hateful externalities. But although it is a universal right, freedom of expression is not an absolute right. To ensure and apply them is always a ridge hike.\nIn a new series, SWI swissinfo.ch deals with these different aspects, challenges, opinions and developments relating to freedom of expression \u2013 both in Switzerland and worldwide.\nWe offer a platform for citizens to look at the topic, provide analyses from renowned scientists and illuminate developments at local and global level. And of course, readers are invited to participate in the discussion and raise their voice this spring.\nThat is why freedom of expression is a human right. It is anchored, inter alia, in Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and in Article 19 of the UN Act on Civil and Political Rights.\nIn Switzerland, the right to freedom of expression was enshrined only in the 1999 Constitution \u2013 but since 1959 as\n.\nis a senior editor of\n, the first independent online magazine for knowledge in Switzerland. Prior to this she had written for the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung for six years and was on the move as a reporter, including in Myanmar.\nAccording to the constitutional author Hertig, freedom of expression protects both appearances of verifiable facts and subjective opinions and emotions \u2013 for example in art \u2013 and symbolic actions \u2013 for example in the form of a seat strike. \"The entire communication process is protected, from spreading to receiving,\" she says. In principle, no one from the state must be prevented from expressing his opinion.\n\"The right to have an opinion is not divisible,\" she explains. So it is not criminal to have a racist attitude. To spread racist appearances, on the other hand.\nBecause the freedom of expression is also limited by law. \"Freedom to express an opinion is not absolute,\" says Hertig. An absolute right is one that can never be restricted \u2013 even in exceptional circumstances such as war, crisis or pandemic. \"There are only a few absolute rights that apply unrestrictedly, for example the ban on torture.\" Torture is never allowed, neither in war nor in peace, nor if the information that one hopes to obtain through torture could protect many lives.\nFreedom of expression ends where other protected goods such as human dignity are violated. This shall apply to:\nlike the Holocaust. But also, for example, the spread of hatred against individual persons or groups of persons is punishable.\nDuring the Corona pandemic, cases have evolved in which large Internet portals such as Youtube canceled contributions due to false statements. Is that a restriction of freedom of expression? Theoretically, so Hertig. But: \"Freedom of expression only protects against interference by the state, it does not directly bind private actors like Youtube.\" With regard to freedom of expression it is therefore only possible to appeal against the State, not against private persons.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nDemocracy vs. Facebook & Co.: The great debate in the USA, Europe and Switzerland about the taming of tech giants.\nThe prohibition of censorship is also primarily directed against the state. Youtube and other channels are private providers that are not directly bound to the constitutional censorship ban. So they are free tolerate what they want on their platform \u2013 and what they don't.\nOnly: \"The State must take appropriate measures to protect freedom of expression against private restrictions,\" says Hertig. This is also true on the Internet and there some platforms now have a monopoly: \"Youtube and other social media are essential today so that citizens can get into a debate.\"\nHowever, the protection of freedom of expression in the network is difficult to provide because companies are often located abroad and unilateral government regulations lead to legal fragmentation. Therefore, more uniform international rules and more transparency are urgent, says Hertig. \"It must be clear what's going on.\" This can also be done through supranational initiatives. For example, large IT companies, including Facebook and Youtube, have a\nto check reports of hate speech within 24 hours. In addition,\nin dealing with desinformation. This is only a matter of\nthe company, so self-regulation.\nHowever, the constitutional author Hertig does not hold any laws that require the deletion of false messages. Legally, it is not generally forbidden to spread false facts. It is also sometimes difficult to define what the \"truth\" is. And in some Asian countries, for example, under the pretext of Fake News, state censorship is being operated. \"It is a part of a democracy that unloved content is also visible,\" she says.\n\"The more diverse the opinion picture, the better it is for democracy,\" says Florian Steger, medical ethicist and director of the Institute for History, Theory and Ethics of Medicine at Ulm University. Listening is a necessary act of the democratic process. A real solution to the problem of false information is not erasing anyway, because \"the opinion remains in the minds\".\nAccording to Steger, citizens' dialogue and transparent communication would be much better. \"Just in a pandemic like this, the evidence base is often inadequate and governments must act out of caution.\" These gaps in knowledge should be mentioned \u2013 even if ignorance is difficult to bear for many people.\nIf posts were deleted, says Steger, it will be quite generally dangerous. \"You can only delete what erodes the state inside. Police and courts are responsible for such deletions.\" Concretely, if the core cells of democracy are threatened with violence, as in the case of the storm on the US Capitol, then the limit of the Sagable is reached.\nCertain critics of the Corona protection measures complain that they are annoyed by their opinion or referred to as \"Corona deniers\" and therefore freedom of expression is exalted. Maya Hertig says: \"Whoever expresses a controversial opinion must also withstand the undermined opinions of the opposite side. It's part of it that you're attacked rhetorically. There is no right not to be criticized.\"\nAnother argument of \"Corona sceptics\": There is a social climate in which no different opinion can be expressed. For example, the web portal Rubikon, which is close to conspiracy theories, writes: \"Request once, in the circle of friends and families, the danger of Covid-19 to deny\". Try to question the meaning and purpose of inoculation. It may be that you reap so aggressively that next time you prefer to remain silent.\" To think differently, socially-attended and freedom of expression is thus de facto not possible.\n\"Freedom of opinion naturally needs a certain social climate,\" says Hertig. \"If there is a climate that leads to self-censorship, this is a problem.\" These include violence and threats, dismissals, and also vehement verbal attacks on others.\n\"Shitstorms\" can also represent a problem according to Hertig. Only those who take the aggressive part often see themselves as victims: \"The social pressure is exaggerated to 'political correctness' and this leads to a victim-taker reversal: the victim is the white racist, not the black one faced with hate speech.\"\nThreats against scientists have increased during the pandemic \u2013 by violence and threats against corona sceptics, nothing can be felt at least in Switzerland. Each and everyone can freely express their opinion and participate in corona demonstrations.\nBut whether the social environment of the rebels brings joys is another question. \"If Corona sceptics feel restricted to saying something, it is often not limited to freedom of expression, but social control,\" says Urte Scholz, Professor of Applied Social and Health Psychology at the University of Zurich.\nSo, if some \"corona sceptics\" see freedom of expression threatened, they can mean at most the social pressure that makes it difficult to express a different opinion.\nWith social control, people try to move their fellow human beings to a certain behavior. \"Social control basically takes place whether we want it or not,\" Scholz explains. \"In a social relationship, it happens because we react.\" And especially in a pandemic, social control can be more common because it is legitimated by official behaviour recommendations and rules.\nHowever, there are different ways to exercise social control. Some lead to positive feelings, others to negative ones. Thus it comes to shame or anger through punishment, nails, deprivation of love or friendship or by creating a bad conscience with the \"controlled\" persons.\nIn studies on social control in relation to the health behaviour of couples, Scholz and her team found that these negative strategies do not bring. They could not establish a link between \"negative\" social control and healthier behavior. On the contrary, the controlled persons often did not exactly what their partners expected \u2013 either demonstrative or secret.\nIn contrast, those who were confronted with positive strategies of social control reacted. Positive strategies include discussing, negotiating, persuading, highlighting the benefits of the desired behaviour, referring to positive examples and compliments. If the partner exercised such positively experienced social control, the \"controlled\" people changed their behaviour rather and felt better.\nNegative social control, such as is presently present in the public, for example, due to nasty gazes or disguise, is not uncommon in a pandemic. But: \"In some circumstances, some people react in opposite ways: they see a dictatorship at work and refuse to comply with the measures.\" These people felt guarded, resisted and tried to restore their autonomy.\nUrte Scholz's research results show that positive strategies for social control would also be desirable during the pandemic. This is what we are talking about: with critics of protection measures, exchange, allow other opinions and do not want to change a behaviour about pressure or negative emotions.\nIf someone sits in the tram without a mask, you could say, \"It would be important for me to wear a mask because I feel more comfortable.\" Or, \"You must have forgotten the mask, it has already happened to me.\" Or offer the other a fresh mask.\nAre such attempts not naive and condemned to fail? \"Whether it comes to such an offer depends heavily on the social context,\" says Scholz. But it is worth an attempt \u2013 and in all, better than simply calling it an \"idiot\".\nArticles in this story\nSet voices of freedom from all over the world\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "en_content": "Social media have become an indispensable space for public debate. But this is rarely seen as a gain in democracy. Much more, they are perceived as a carrier of fake news, conspiracy theories and hate messages. In 2017, the Federal Council in Switzerland came to the conclusion: \"No new regulatory requirements for social media.\" At the same time, the fears that private tech companies exert too much power with them and make unpleasant voices disappear.\nSWI #Freedom of Thought Series\nIn principle, everything should be clear. Both in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and in the UN Act on Civil and Political Rights (1966), Article 19 states: \"Everyone and everyone has the right to free expression of opinion; this right implies freedom to seek, receive and disseminate information and thoughts of any kind, whether oral, written or printed, by art or by another medium of its choice.\"\nIn Europe, the European Human Rights Convention (1950) confirms freedom of expression as legally binding law (Article 10). Switzerland anchors this fundamental freedom in Article 16 of its 1999 constitution.\nIn practice, however, much remains controversial. Governments around the world do not protect the right to freedom of expression, but increasingly undermine it. In other parts of the world, individuals and groups use the term \"freedom of opinion\" to justify discriminatory and hateful externalities. But although it is a universal right, freedom of expression is not an absolute right. To ensure and apply them is always a ridge hike.\nIn a new series, SWI swissinfo.ch deals with these different aspects, challenges, opinions and developments relating to freedom of expression \u2013 both in Switzerland and worldwide.\nWe offer a platform for citizens to look at the topic, provide analyses from renowned scientists and illuminate developments at local and global level. And of course, readers are invited to participate in the discussion and raise their voice this spring.\n\"These companies have enormous power. You have too much power, especially the huge players, the social media platforms and search engine operators. They are able to move not only masses of consumers, but also masses of voters. This is becoming increasingly clear and this power must now be addressed,\" warns cyber expert Marietje Schaake in Interwiew with SWI swissinfo.ch against the dangers of unregulated social media.\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\"In the USA, we see where lies and the apron of hatred and violence actually lead in the net\" \u2013 Interview with Marietje Schaake.\nWhat would have to happen so that social exchange on the Internet is again regarded as a profit for democracy? Who can stop polarisation \u2013 and how? Politics by creating laws? The tech companies by giving themselves rules? Or civil society by sanctioning what you don't care?\nEspecially in society, many experts see the solution. The change must be thought of from below, from the user's side, argues about Taiwan's digital minister Audrey Tang. You could say: Change must be democratic.\nHowever, many countries try to deal with the problems with new laws and regulations. Germany took on a leading role with the \"Network Implementation Act\" (NetzDG). This law affects all platforms with more than two million users in Germany. You must ensure that complaints are carefully examined and all illegal content removed within 24 hours. In 2019, Facebook had to pay a penalty of 2 million euros because it did not comply with these requirements.\nThe German law is an export success: scientists from the Danish think tank Justitia represented a total of 25 countries that discussed or implemented laws inspired by the NetzDG by October 2020.\nThe problem: The basic idea of the German model can easily be abused by less democratic governments. The Danish researchers note in their report that the \"Network Investigation Act\" contains legal guarantees and protection of the free expression of opinion, which were not equally adopted by all countries.\nWith its new rules, India wants to ban content that threatens the \"unity, integrity, defence, security and sovereignty of India\" \u2013 a formulation that seems to be created to bring unloved voices to tumult.\nRussia also explicitly refers to the example of NetzDG in regulations against fake news. In addition, the legal framework was created in 2020 so that the Internet can be completely paralyzed in an undefined \"emergency case\".\nWhat for some is the fight against hatred serves others for censorship. For Petra Grimm, Professor of Digital Ethics at the Stuttgart University of Media, it is clear that freedom of expression is always linked to certain barriers, as freedom in principle.\"\nIn Poland, confrontation follows a long-lasting dispute between Facebook and politicians from the government party, who have repeatedly spread anti-LGBT messages in social media and have therefore been banished by the platform.\nWhile most countries are concerned with preventing dangerous or unpopular content on the Internet, Poland and Hungary are pursuing a different approach: they want to prevent Facebook and Co. from blocking user profiles as long as the mails do not break domestic law.\nHungary's Minister of Justice reads in February (on Facebook), the big social media wanted to \"restrict the visibility of Christian, conservative, right-wing opinions\".\nIn Switzerland, regulations specifically adapted to social media have been lacking. Network activist Jolanda Spiess-Hegglin, who fights against hatred in the net with the organization Netzcourage, sees need for action. She says, \"A federal councilwoman should decide: Now we call a working group and work out a Hate-Speech law.\"\nIt is too easy to get away with discriminatory or malicious calls, for example by saying that one has been hacked or someone else has been behind the computer.\nethic Grimm, in turn, emphasizes not only the policy is in duty: \"It is also a responsibility of tech companies, a responsibility for self-control.\"\nIn some countries, Facebook or Twitter are now calling for clearer regulations. Spiess-Hegglin doesn't believe this: \"If companies demand clearer rules from the state, it's like a murderer would say: 'You don't have to sell me a knife, otherwise I'm dying!'\"\nCommercial social platforms will hardly change significantly. The basic problem is structural, says Grimm: \"News that are very spectacular, that go beyond the truth or heat the minds above all are particularly often clicked. And clicks are of course the business of social media.\" Spiess-Hegglin summarizes this: \"The social media allow hate speech because it brings clicks and money.\"\nWhat's the way out? \"An alternative social network that works according to the principles of public understanding requires communication without commercial exploitation,\" says Grimm.\nWhat the professor is doing already exists. For example, in Taiwan: The platform PTT, often described as the Reddit Taiwan, is funded by the National University, regardless of advertising money or shareholders.\nAudrey Tang, Taiwan's digital minister, presents this system in an interview with SWI swissinfo.ch to the commercial providers, which it calls \"anti-social\" media, as a more socially valuable example.\nIn order for the social media to change for the better, pressure must come from society, explains Tang. One example: In Taiwan, civil society successfully demanded more transparency in politics. \"This hard-fighted, radical transparency regarding political campaign financing has become a norm.\" In Taiwan, it now also bends Facebook and exposes political advertising in real time: \"We have not introduced a law for this. It is based solely on social sanctions.\"\nMore\n\n\n\n\nAudrey Tang, Taiwan's digital minister, in an interview on \"antisocial\" media and democratic competencies.\nAlso in direct exchange with one another there must be a rethinking, Spiess-Hegglin is convinced: \"We need to learn to maintain a communication that does not distinguish.\" She notes: \"The social media are basically a gift, especially for activists who are hardly heard in traditional media.\"\n\"It is about building a virtue culture of social media from the user side,\" Grimm is convinced. \"We need a new narrative. This narrative should be more optimistic and value-oriented.\" It needs efforts with political support to create alternatives to commercial tech giants. \"That would have to be at least European\" \u2013 Switzerland is there.\nAt the moment, however, a European regulation is not the focus of the Swiss authorities. Although the Federal Office for Communication examines possible governance approaches for online platforms, it seeks its own Swiss solution. Matthias Ammann from the liberal think tank Avenir Suisse prefers to rely on the verdict of the enlightened citizens rather than on regulations. Finally they also trust them with the direct democracy of Switzerland, he writes in the\n.\nArticles in this story\nSet voices of freedom from all over the world\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "en_content": "School breaker, hacker, Minister: This is Audrey Tang. As a digital minister, she is supposed to make Taiwan a digital showcase. At the latest since the small island state has mastered the pandemic as well as hardly any other country, Tang is omnipresent in international media.\nSWI #Freedom of Thought Series\nIn principle, everything should be clear. Both in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and in the UN Act on Civil and Political Rights (1966), Article 19 states: \"Everyone and everyone has the right to free expression of opinion; this right implies freedom to seek, receive and disseminate information and thoughts of any kind, whether oral, written or printed, by art or by another medium of its choice.\"\nIn Europe, the European Human Rights Convention (1950) confirms freedom of expression as legally binding law (Article 10). Switzerland anchors this fundamental freedom in Article 16 of its 1999 constitution.\nIn practice, however, much remains controversial. Governments around the world do not protect the right to freedom of expression, but increasingly undermine it. In other parts of the world, individuals and groups use the term \"freedom of opinion\" to justify discriminatory and hateful externalities. But although it is a universal right, freedom of expression is not an absolute right. To ensure and apply them is always a ridge hike.\nIn a new series, SWI swissinfo.ch deals with these different aspects, challenges, opinions and developments relating to freedom of expression \u2013 both in Switzerland and worldwide.\nWe offer a platform for citizens to look at the topic, provide analyses from renowned scientists and illuminate developments at local and global level. And of course, readers are invited to participate in the discussion and raise their voice this spring.\nShe does not work for the government, but with the government, she says in the\n. It is not a large ministry with budgets and employees, but a direct link between the government and the electorate, activists and activists.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nViolence calls, conspiracy theories and censorship: The reputation of social media is on the ground. How will the Internet become a profit for democracy?\nChina still sees the state with 23 million inhabitants as part of the Chinese territory. Only a few countries maintain official diplomatic relations with Taiwan \u2013 Switzerland is not part of it. Under this pressure, Taiwan turned into a flagship democracy: In the latest democracy ranking of the magazine The Economist, Taiwan is placed just before Switzerland. Innovative forms of online participation play an important role.\nAudrey Tang: I do not often think in the categories of optimism and pessimism. I think in the categories of pro-social, civil society infrastructure, unlike an anti-social, rather private infrastructure.\nSocial media, antisocial or prosocial, can remain social. Just as we have meeting places of people who speak in a city hall, in a public debate in a park, structured around politics in an academic environment. These are public infrastructures.\nYou can also talk about politics in a loud bar, in a nightclub where people have to scream to be heard, with addictive drinks, private doorkeepers and so on. This is also a talk about politics, but perhaps not necessarily a prosocial one.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland is \"world champion\" in analogue direct democracy. Taiwan is the world's leading point of digital, participatory democracy.\nAs with these physical spaces, we also have different configurations of social interaction in the digital space. In Taiwan, the sunflower movement has created our own communication infrastructure, in a way that is often referred to as \"situational application\".\nThis allows us to program the digital spaces themselves when a need for communication arises. We do not adapt to the rather unsocial side of social media. We can shape the interaction as the participants want. This has been the case here in Taiwan for a while, for 25 years.\nThe town hall isn't just a house, is it? The town hall is a system of standards, as you speak and listen alternately. These standards are important. The Taiwanese idea of democracy as a form of technology captures this standard very well. People do not just report to protest when they think something is wrong with the existing democratic process.\nThey also report to show how things could work better. So you\u2019ll also design how we can try different software layouts or designs from public parks.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe island is a democracy newcomer. But in digital democracy they are world class. We say why.\nI would like to point out that in the last century one has often said: \"One must be formed to participate in democracy.\" Nowadays we say, \"You must have competence to participate in digital democracy.\"\nThe difference between competence and education is that education is about receiving. Competence is about shaping.\nInstead of telling the very young people: \"You must be an adult to participate in democracy,\" we say, \"No, go ahead and start your citizens' initiatives.\" More than a quarter of citizens' initiatives are digital democracies that are launched by people younger than 18 and are also very effective, such as the ban on plastic straws in our national drink, the Bubble Tea.\nThe focus is on lifelong learning, solidarity between generations, mutual mentoring. We want to guarantee that all young people can determine the agenda so that they feel involved in democracy even before they grow up.\nIf they are prepared to act pro-socially, many of their existing infrastructures could be positive. However, if they do not work in a pro-social way, they know that they have to expect social sanctions in Taiwan.\nIf people already have a firm idea of what is considered to be a standard, the multinational media companies that have failed to comply with the standard will have great difficulties in getting through.\nIf society fails to have an established social standard, for example in the field of transparency in electoral campaign financing, then social media can, of course, completely ignore the state.\nIn Taiwan, civil society literally occupied Parliament and called for transparency. It has been moved to the National Audit Office, has collected the reports on the electoral issue and scanned them for machine-readable data.\nThis hard-fighted, radical transparency regarding political campaign financing has become the norm. For this reason, Facebook cannot refuse to convert the political advertisements in real time into publicly available data. Foreign interference or financing is prohibited, similar to that of both campaign financing.\nWe have not introduced a law. It is based solely on social sanctions.\nYes, among the factual examiners there are many pupils. This is also part of the competence.\nPeople can mark content for a \"Gegen-Infodemie-Tool\" such as Line.\nIf something is marked, the dashboard shows on the line platform, which is currently in the trend without saying whether it is disinformation, fraud, hate speech or something else. Very neutral, as if these messages would go viral.\nWhat is viral is not necessarily toxic. However, if this is the case, early recognition allows us to deal with this: that humour acts better than the rumor \u2013 humor over rumor. If you only wait one night, people associate these viral memes with long-term memory.\nIf within a few hours we roll out a comic response to toxic content, it motivates people to share joy and not retaliation or discrimination or revenge. You feel better. But the key is the timely reaction. In the net, the best plans do not work if you wait a few days.\nArticles in this story\nSet voices of freedom from all over the world\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "en_content": "The Uno Special Rapporteur Irene Khan criticises Switzerland for the violation of press freedom, in the ranking of \"reporters without borders\" the country has slipped away and otherwise there are negative presses on media freedom.\nWhat's going on? We talked to the lawyer, investigative journalist and chief director of a well-known Swiss news and consumer magazine, Dominique Strebel.\nDominique Strebel is a lawyer and journalist. He worked as a SRF federal court correspondent, editor of journals Observer and pleading, as a journalist at \"NZ on Sunday\", \"Tages-Anzeiger\" and the Republic. Today he is the head of the news and consumer magazine Observer, blogger, media lawyer, research coach and lecturer at the Swiss Journalist School MAZ.\nDominique Strebel: I have the feeling that Switzerland has built a protective wall around the banking and financial industries against unpopular research.\nIn 2015, two laws were introduced with a similar\nsupplemented by the fact that cooperation in a search for information under the banking secrecy has already been declared criminal.\nSource protection in Switzerland also has a heavy impact on the financial and banking industry: not only in the case of murder and death, media professionals must award their source, but also in money laundering. Any source providing information on money laundering must therefore be expected that a journalist or a journalist must disclose their name to the prosecutor's office if the information is under the banking secrecy.\nThis shows that the banking and financial industry \u2013 or parliament \u2013 misses a muzzle in Switzerland.\nI do not have an overview of all countries. But the handling of whistleblowers, for example, is a different one in the Anglo-Saxon area than in Switzerland, which are sometimes even reconciled when they make information public.\nAnd in Germany there is no such rule as in Swiss banking law that the disclosure of information under the banking secrecy is criminal. This was shown in the searches for Suisse Secrets, where German journalists could do this work and the Swiss weren't doing it because they were criminal.\nIn February 2022, media in an international cooperation based on corporate bank data made public that the Swiss Grossbank Credit Suisse has helped decades of criminals and dictators hide their money. More information\n, which fights against corruption among others.\nIn the Swiss Criminal Code an article is missing, according to which the safeguarding of legitimate public interests similar to emergency or emergency can be a justification ground. This leads to cases such as that of a local journalist who was sentenced to first and second instance because she had entered an occupied house for a report. She was only acquitted by the federal court \u2013 but because of a lack of intention. A classic way out with a striking result. But unsatisfactory for journalism because the signal remains: does not research on occupied land.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nFor years, the Grossbank CS should have had controversial leaders and corrupt officials as customers, says an international search network.\nAt the moment such a justification is provided only for individual facts. The dishes sometimes fill the gap, but are very reserved. They would have to deal with the balance between media freedom and prosecution interest today. However, various new judgments by the European Court of Human Rights show that Swiss courts do so inadequately.\nIf, in general, part of the Criminal Code there were such an article, journalists could argue in court that the offence of bank secrecy was fulfilled, but their action was justified because they acted in public interest. The courts would then have to consider in individual cases the justification for the safeguarding of legitimate public interests, and would not only do so incompletely and withholding if they weigh between media freedom and law enforcement interests. This is what Uno's special rapporteur Irene Khan demands from Switzerland.\n(laughs) I think that's exaggerated. What gives me thought: The federal court is very restrictive, especially at the level of research techniques. We have to fight our freedom of media again and again in Strassburg before the European Court of Human Rights.\nAn example of source protection: A journalist from Basler Zeitung reported about a cannabis dealer. The Prosecutor's Office then asked her to announce the name of this trader, because in Swiss law there is an exception to the protection of sources in drug trafficking if a profit of more than 10,000 francs is achieved. Only the court in Strassburg was right to the journalist and said that it was not human rights compliant to prevent media workers from protecting their sources. The prosecution interest in such a case does not justify the intervention in media freedom.\nAlso at the hidden camera, Strassburg has whipped back the Swiss federal court. We are currently waiting for a verdict when storing data. Specifically, it is about the law enforcement authorities having insights into mobile radio data from media professionals for six months. So you see who had contact with whom, which digitally undermines source protection.\nIn the field of research, the Swiss courts distrust important research methods, which are now scorching certain principles such as trust and faith, but are necessary. Say whistleblower, hidden camera and hidden research, as dishes in Switzerland have inhibitions, which means that Strassburg has to intervene repeatedly correctively.\nI don't know if it's a mentality question, probably a legal tradition. Previously, the courts were also very restrictive as regards the issue of secret documents from the administration. The state is trapped in itself because he wants to keep information about his own activity secret.\nMore\n\nStable land, stable money, stable life plans: In comparison, a lot runs around Switzerland. One factor is the high confidence.\nIt has something paternalistic. One has the feeling that the journalist may not get into his hands. You do not trust the journalist that they can judge themselves whether they can publish something or not. And you do not trust your own legislation \u2013 that is, the protection of criminal and civil rights and the protection against unfair competition is sufficient.\nOn the one hand, I am often faced with requests for deletion. So people are calling on their personal rights, in particular on the right to forget. It is sometimes necessary to make it clear that an article is right to stay online for a certain period of time, including name naming. For example, if someone has committed a failure to warn people, there is a public interest.\nI am aware that the eternal availability of texts is a quantum leap compared to earlier, when you had to get to the archive to read an article. How to maintain personality rights without hindering journalistic work, this is still an open question and I am experiencing challenges.\nSo I am most often experiencing deletion requests, followed by counter-representation requests. And you have to think about when you call a name. You have to consider each decision whether it is in court.\nI don't feel that way, at least not in comparison with Germany and Austria. In the Anglo-Saxon area, however, personality rights and data protection are less pronounced. This has a long tradition. There I can also simply approach files of criminal proceedings in which the names of the parties are mentioned. In this respect, Swiss courts are very restrictive \u2013 in my opinion too restrictive.\n\nSign up for our newsletter and receive swissinfo.ch's top stories directly in your mailbox.\nI think it's the practice. But, of course, media professionals are too flexible with regard to a possible procedural consequences. It also has to do with the fear that things can't be documented or untruthed. You want to secure yourself by giving a quotation or a part of the content to read back.\nThere is hardly any concrete criminal proceedings on the right to speak. It is not that massive people complain because something that was quoted by them has not been said so. That is why I say it is more of work practice and foreseeable obedience than really a legal practice that would be restrictive. To make the journalist courage, I have a meaningful way of dealing with quotations and interviews in my\nsketched.\nI can only speak from the point of view of a consumer magazine. Those companies we hurt are often SMEs. We cover maladministrations and also report on smaller businesses that are damaging consumers with a fraudulent mash. Our experience shows that even smaller businesses are also defending themselves, often before printing an article.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThey investigate cancer treatment, feel mines in Ukraine, rescue coral reefs or develop sustainable packaging from fungal tissue.\nBut it is clear that the little man and the little woman who are already struggling with the turmoil that triggers a negative media report in the circle of friends and families will hardly have the baptism and the means to start a mediation process.\nIn the short and medium term, they benefit from the fact that certain research is not done and because whistleblowers do not dare to speak publicly.\nIn the long term, however, it is harmful. Legislation, which prevents the working up of deficiencies and maladministration, is rather harmful in the long term. Because in the end it comes back to us via pressure from abroad. This may cost the banking and financial center more than if you would work it up yourself.\nArticles in this story\nSet voices of freedom from all over the world\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

After discovering that Turkey was illegally supplying weapons to Syria in 2015, D\u00fcndar was accused of spying and terrorist support in several processes.\nAfter a failed attack \u2013 a man shot him in front of a courthouse \u2013 the journalist left the country in 2016. He was sentenced to high penalties in the absence, and his assets in Turkey were confiscated.\nToday D\u00fcndar lives in Germany and is head of the Webradio\n. He continues his fight for a democratic Turkey from exile. In an interview with swissinfo.ch he says: \"Free expression is like breathing, like drinking water, like breastfeeding hunger. Unfortunately, we have been unable to breathe in our country for some time, are thirsty and hungry.\" It is the task of journalists to \"freeze the airways\".\nTurkey is now on a route: One way to an autocratic regime, perhaps even to a dictatorship. The other way to build a democracy. A democratic Turkey is a great opportunity for the region, for Europe, for the world. To work on this is the task of a journalist in exile.\nMore\n\nStable land, stable money, stable life plans: In comparison, a lot runs around Switzerland. One factor is the high confidence.\nSet voices of freedom from all over the world",

These are the people behind the voices that we have met for our short video series \"Voices of Freedom from all over the world\". Around the world, in very different places, under the most diverse conditions and in many different contexts, they make themselves strong for freedom of expression and democracy.\nOur journey to the \"Voices of Freedom\" begins on the small Japanese island of Ishigaki, almost 2000 kilometers south of Tokyo. The 28-year-old Manami Mihara lives here.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nA small island in the South Japanese Sea became a centre of direct democracy.\nFrom Ishigaki and the East China Sea we travel to Central Asia and Afghanistan, where in recent years the Islamist Taliban regime has radically cut the rights of the female population.

She fled and continues her fight for freedom in Italy.\nEllie Kisyombe, who came from East African Malawi and arrived more than ten years ago as an asylum seeker in the Irish capital Dublin, is the next stop for our virtual journey around the globe.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nEllie Kisyombe has managed to be heard in Ireland \u2013 the first asylum seeker to become a politician.\nIn Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, re-elected in May, has taken the country step by step from democracy in the last twenty years. Critics like the journalist Can D\u00fcndar had to leave his country. From Germany, he has been committed to the democratic future of his homeland.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe climate in Turkey has been more repressive for years. The journalist Can D\u00fcndar had to leave his country.\nIn Russia, the situation for media professionals has deteriorated so since the beginning of the war of attack against neighbor Ukraine that independent journalists such as the Russian-Ukrainian chief redactor of the online platform Meduza Galina Timchenko are now reporting from the Latvian capital Riga.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nGalina Timchenko, the Russian-Ukrainian chief director of Meduza.io, writes what Russian media can no longer publish.\nBut even in countries where democracy has made progress in recent years, journalists live dangerously. Like in Mexico, where there are \"no security guarantees for freedom of expression\" \u2013 said Joel Vera to SWI swissinfo.ch.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nJoel Vera, journalist in Mexico: He had to close his news portal after the murder of two colleagues.\nAnd even in a stable and old democracy like Switzerland, freedom of press and opinion is sometimes under pressure. Marie Maurisse, who at SWI swissinfo.ch with the podcast \"\n\"is present, gives out the online magazine Gotham City in the Swiss city of Lausanne. Together with her team, she covers economic crimes and experiences the limits of press freedom every day.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nA new law would prevent journalists from writing an article as they want, says the Swiss investigative author.\nThese voices by journalists: insiders from different countries and continents of the world make clear why freedom of the press is such a high asset for which it is worth making every day.\nWhat are your most important voices of freedom?

After eleven days of intense struggles on the 21st May a ceasefire was negotiated, mainly through the mediation of Egypt and the UN, and a mutual and simultaneous attitude of the fighting.\nMore than 230 Palestinians died and 11 death victims were counted in Israel. The injured go to the thousands, the infrastructure damage is immense in the Gaza Strip.\nEven during the warfare, Jewish organizations in Switzerland demanded the classification of Hamas as a terrorist organization. In a\nthe Swiss Jewish Community Federation (SIG) and the platform of Swiss liberal Jews (PLJS) described Hamas as \"clearly extremist, terrorist and anti-Semitic\". It could not be that \"the Hamas can move freely in Switzerland, collect donations and finance.\" The Israeli Embassy in Bern demanded the same.\nThe demand is not new:\nSVP National Council Christian Imark from the Federal Council to ban Hamas or to classify it as a terrorist organization. On request, Imark explains after the latest escalation: \"The Hamas as a terrorist organization would still be right. Especially because Hamas repeatedly acts as an aggressor and uses its own population as human shields.\"\nIn fact, only al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS) have been considered as terrorist organisations in Switzerland. Direct talks with them are not possible for the Swiss government. And this is also the reason why the Federal Council so far did not want to respond to the demand: as part of its peace policy in the region, it is important to talk to all actors and to be able to offer the good services of Switzerland. Both between Israel and the Palestinians and the internal Palestinian dialogue between the Islamist Hamas and the secular Fatah.\nThis has not changed after the latest outbreak of violence. On request, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informs: \"The EDA has taken note of the SIG's demand. Switzerland\u2019s [...] mentioned position is still valid. Hamas denies Israel's right of existence and defends the armed struggle as a legitimate means of resistance. Switzerland condemns these positions in all clarity.\"\nSwitzerland has been in contact with all conflict parties and has also called on Hamas in Gaza to stop all violence and to ensure compliance with international humanitarian law and human rights.\nThe fact that the EU did not play a significant role in the arms movement has several reasons. Since it has classified Hamas as a terrorist organization, it cannot conduct direct talks with it \u2013 the same applies to numerous other states. Some have only classified the military arm of Hamas, the al-Quds Brigades, as terrorist, but not the entire organization.\nThe pressure that Hamas should be classified as terrorist has increased after the recent escalation in various countries. For example, the German Chancellor candidate of the Union demanded that Armin Laschet (CDU) prohibit the flag of Hamas, while others spoke for a total ban on the organisation. Hamas is also not prohibited in Germany.\nHowever, it wonders how a ban would be targeted \u2013 according to analysts, Hamas is now considered to be the strongest political force beyond the Gaza Strip: there it has been ruling since 2007, in the West Bank and among the Arab Israelis, and it continues to gain support. The Middle East expert Erich Gysling interviewed the\nthe dilemma: \"The Hamas is the political winner on the Palestinian side. You have to stay in touch with them. To call them terrorists does not help anyone.\"\nMore\nDebates\nIs Switzerland cowardly or clever not to call Hamas a terrorist organization?\nMore\n\nAs Switzerland is struggling with its traditional neutrality concept.\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                    "Wenn Amir Malcus den Kinderwagen spazieren f\u00e4hrt, l\u00e4uft er an einer linksalternativen Bar vorbei. Ein Schild davor teilt mit: Rassismus wird nicht toleriert, ebenso wenig wie Sexismus, Homophobie und weitere Diskriminierungsformen. Aber ein Begriff fehlt: Antisemitismus. Typisch Linke, findet der 37-j\u00e4hrige Sozialarbeiter.",
                    "Obwohl Malcus sich lange Jahre engagierte, ist er heute von der Linken entt\u00e4uscht: \"F\u00fcr mich war es frustrierend, zu erleben, wie verbreitet Antisemitismus in dem Teil der Gesellschaft ist, in den ich die meiste Hoffnung legte.\"",
                    "Antisemitismus ist in der Gesellschaft weit verbreitet \u2013 so auch in der politischen Linken. swissinfo.ch hat Schweizer J\u00fcd:innen, Historiker:innen und Aktivist:innen, die sich der Linken zurechnen oder zurechneten, gefragt, wie sie den Umgang mit Antisemitismus in diesem Umfeld erleben.",
                    "\nMelden Sie sich f\u00fcr unseren Newsletter an und Sie erhalten die Top-Geschichten von swissinfo.ch direkt in Ihre Mailbox. ",
                    "Im konservativen Tal, in dem Malcus aufwuchs, geh\u00f6rte Antisemitismus zum Alltag. In den kleinen Gruppen, mit denen er H\u00e4user besetzte, konnte er \u00fcber antisemitische Stereotypen aufkl\u00e4ren, etwa, dass nicht alle J\u00fcd:innen reich sind. Als er sich aus dem Tal rauswagte und sich globalen Themen widmete, merkte er, dass der Antisemitismus nicht nur in seinem Tal allgegenw\u00e4rtig war.",
                    "An Sitzungen erlebte er regelm\u00e4ssig Ausf\u00e4lle gegen Israel: \"Parolen wie 'Wir werden euer Land niederbrennen' waren nicht an mich gerichtet, aber ich habe sie geh\u00f6rt.\" An Demonstrationen gegen den Irakkrieg oder das Weltwirtschaftsforum WEF verst\u00f6rten Malcus die unreflektierte Verwendung von Karikaturen von Kapitalisten, die nicht selten wie antisemitische Karikaturen wirkten.",
                    "Eine unterkomplexe Kapitalismuskritik ist anschlussf\u00e4hig an antisemitische Weltbilder, in denen angebliche \"Strippenzieher\" die Kontrolle innehaben, und bedient sich oft judenfeindlicher Bilder mit langer Tradition. Das zeigte etwa die jungsozialistische Partei Juso, die w\u00e4hrend eines Abstimmungskampfs 2016 eine Karikatur ver\u00f6ffentlichte, in der ein \"Spekulant\" als Mann mit grosser Nase, Zylinder und Schl\u00e4fenlocken dargestellt wurde.",
                    "\"Antisemitismus ist ein Verwandlungsk\u00fcnstler\", sagt Dina Wyler, die bis vor kurzer Zeit bei der Stiftung gegen Rassismus und Antisemitismus GRA arbeitete.\u00a0\"Er passt sich immer an die geltenden Narrative an und tritt oft auch \u00fcber Bildsprache oder codierte W\u00f6rter in Erscheinung, um 'salonf\u00e4hig' zu bleiben.\"",
                    "Die Ausf\u00e4lle gegen Israel, die Malcus in den 2000ern erlebt hatte, geh\u00f6rten da schon seit Jahrzehnten zu etwas, was die Schweizer Linken zumindest in Kauf genommen hat. In seiner Z\u00fcrcher Kindheit w\u00e4hrend des Zweiten Weltkriegs in den 1940ern haben Kinder Steine nach Emanuel Hurwitz geschmissen und ihm antisemitische Beleidigungen nachgerufen.",
                    "\"Diesen offensichtlichen Antisemitismus habe ich sp\u00e4ter in der Linken nie erlebt\", stellt er im Gespr\u00e4ch mit swissinfo.ch klar. Nach dem Studium engagierte sich Hurwitz in der sozialdemokratischen Partei. Er wurde ins Parlament des Kanton Z\u00fcrich gew\u00e4hlt, politisierte im linken Fl\u00fcgel. Die Haltung der SP zum Nahostkonflikt empfand Hurwitz in den 1970ern als reflektiert.",
                    "Doch dies habe sich mit dem Beginn des Libanon-Kriegs, in dem Israel als Aggressor auftrat, ge\u00e4ndert. \"Ab 1982 herrschte unglaubliche Erregung in der SP\", erinnert sich Hurwitz. Er sei als j\u00fcdischer Vertreter in der Linken an \"unz\u00e4hlige Podiumsdiskussionen\" eingeladen worden, die sich dann \"als reine Propagandaveranstaltungen zugunsten der PLO\" entpuppten. Dabei seien ihm \"seltsame Argumentationsmuster\" aufgefallen: \"Israel war das B\u00f6se und die pal\u00e4stinensische PLO hat begeisterte Zustimmung erfahren.\"",
                    "Der \"Hass und Fanatismus, der da durchbrach\", habe ihn \u00fcberrascht und \u00fcberrumpelt. F\u00fcr diese D\u00e4monisierung findet er nur eine Erkl\u00e4rung: \"Antisemitismus.\" Hurwitz, von Beruf Psychiater, hat damals versucht, das seinen Genoss:innen zu erkl\u00e4ren: Wie eine jahrhundertealte Tradition antisemitischer Vorurteile in einer politisch aufgeladenen Situation an die Oberfl\u00e4che dringen kann.",
                    "Seine Genoss:innen haben das nicht h\u00f6ren wollen. Am 1. Mai 1984 trat Hurwitz aus dem Parlament zur\u00fcck und aus der Partei aus. Zur Aussprache, die ihm die SP Z\u00fcrich vor beinahe 40 Jahren versprach, ist es nie gekommen. Doch seit 2019 definiert die SP Schweiz f\u00fcr sich und ihre Gremien Antisemitismus nach der IHRA-Definition, die israelbezogene Formen von Antisemitismus explizit miteinschliesst. Gegen\u00fcber swissinfo.ch sagte Hurwitz, dass ihm diese sp\u00e4te Einsicht seiner Ex-Genoss:innen schon etwas bedeute. Im Februar ist er 86j\u00e4hrig verstorben.",
                    "Berthold Rothschild verband mit Emanuel Hurwitz eine lange Freundschaft. Rothschild politisierte in den 1980ern in der kommunistischen Partei der Arbeit (PdA). Lange habe bei den Kommunist:innen Israel als \"heroische Nation in den Geburtswehen\" gegolten, erz\u00e4hlt Rothschild. \"Genauso pl\u00f6tzlich drehte es dann.\"\u00a0Bevor er \u2013 zu \u00e4hnlicher Zeit wie Hurwitz \u2013 aus der PdA ausgetreten ist, habe er immer mal wieder erlebt, wie unter Kommunist:innen Stereotypen auftraten, etwa, dass J\u00fcd:innen die Linke im Zweifelsfall verraten w\u00fcrden.",
                    "Rothschild betont das Dilemma, das er bis heute in Bezug auf Israel/Pal\u00e4stina empfindet: Er habe sehr gute Freund:innen, die gegen\u00fcber dem Judenhass von Hizbollah oder Hammas lange blind waren. Er habe um diese Freundschaften immer gerungen, sei aber bei manchen \u00c4usserungen schon abrupt aufgestanden und nachhause gegangen. Gleichzeitig verstehe er, dass die israelische Politik und ihr Umgang mit den Pal\u00e4stinenser:innen viele Linke emp\u00f6re \u2013 und die Emp\u00f6rung ja oft begr\u00fcndet sei.",
                    "Eine Freundin engagiere sich vor Ort f\u00fcr die Bev\u00f6lkerung von Gaza. \"Ich verstehe, dass man propal\u00e4stinensisch wird, wenn man diese Situation erlebt. Damit einhergeht, dass man fanatisch antiisraelisch wird.\" Antiisraelisch heisse nicht antisemitisch. \"Aber es ist nicht weit davon entfernt.\" Antisemitismus, sagt Rothschild, sei in der Linken unaufgel\u00f6st, verleugnet, verdr\u00e4ngt.",
                    "Damit sie da nicht in antisemitische Chiffren fallen, m\u00fcssen sich diese Aktivist:innen extrem genau beobachten. \"So wie ich mir des Rassismus, den mir die Gesellschaft mitgibt, bewusst bin, hoffe ich, dass sich andere bewusst sind, dass sie antisemitische Z\u00fcge in sich tragen.\"",
                    "Manche befreundete Linke seien so reflektiert, dass sie Rothschild Flyer oder Polittexte zur Testlekt\u00fcre vorlegen: Transportiert der Text unbeabsichtigt antisemitische Stereotypen? Doch das sind eher Ausnahmen.",
                    "Laut dem stellvertretenden Leiter des Zentrums f\u00fcr J\u00fcdische Studien der Universit\u00e4t Basel, Erik Petry, muss die Linie von Fall zu Fall gezogen werden: \"Oft kommt eine toxische Mischung zusammen, die eben nicht auf einer Kritik an der Politik des Staates beruht, sondern auf der Annahme, dass es hier ein unmoralisches Verhalten gibt, das mit dem J\u00fcdischsein zu tun hat.\" Das erlebe Petry auf linker Seite oft.",
                    "Politische Gegner:innen heben gerne hervor, dass es auch einen linken Antisemitismus gibt. Die Historikerin Christina Sp\u00e4ti beobachtet Versuche mancher \"rechter\" Politiker:innen sich so vom eigenen Antisemitismus \"reinzuwaschen\". Das bedeute aber nicht, dass es den linken Antisemitismus nicht wirklich gebe, sagt die Professorin an der Universit\u00e4t Fribourg und der FernUni Schweiz.",
                    "In ihrer Dissertation \"Die schweizerische Linke und Israel \u2013 Israelbegeisterung, Antizionismus und Antisemitismus zwischen 1967 und 1991\" ordnete Sp\u00e4ti in n\u00fcchterner Sprache Zeitungsberichte und Vorf\u00e4lle ein, die antisemitische Ressentiments in linken Kreisen offenbaren.",
                    "So erschien etwa in der sozialdemokratischen Presse 1970 ein Kommentar, der die Entf\u00fchrung Adolf Eichmanns durch Israel als \"Schlag ins Gesicht Argentiniens\" geisselte. Die gr\u00f6sste linke Zeitung der Schweiz verglich die israelische Politik in den 1980er-Jahren mehrfach mit der Politik der \"Endl\u00f6sung\" \u2013\u00a0dem Naziwort f\u00fcr die Ausl\u00f6schung der J\u00fcd:innen in Europa.",
                    "Sp\u00e4ti liefert unz\u00e4hlige weitere Beispiele. Immerhin der Kommentar zu Eichmanns Entf\u00fchrung hat beim Erscheinen 1970 zu einem Aufschrei gef\u00fchrt. Zu grotesk war der Antisemitismus in dem Artikel. Die subtileren Vorf\u00e4lle erfuhren keine vergleichbare Reaktion. Sp\u00e4ti kommt zum Fazit, es gebe eine \"Kontinuit\u00e4t der linken Indifferenz gegen\u00fcber Antisemitismus\". W\u00e4hrend in Deutschland in den 1990ern eine Reflexion startete, sei es in der Schweiz ein Tabu geblieben, erz\u00e4hlt sie im Gespr\u00e4ch mit swissinfo.ch.",
                    "Doch in den letzten Jahren nimmt Sp\u00e4ti innerhalb linker Kreise ein wachsendes Bed\u00fcrfnis wahr, sich mit Antisemitismus im eigenen Umfeld auseinanderzusetzen. Eine linke Aktivistin gegen Antisemitismus hat swissinfo.ch geschildert, wie ihr in den 1990er-Jahren bei Aufkl\u00e4rungsveranstaltungen zum Thema in Z\u00fcrich, andere Linke,\u00a0M\u00e4nner, mit einem \"Schuss ins Knie\" gedroht haben. Anfang 2000er l\u00f6sten ein Text und eine Karikatur auf der Plattform Indymedia eine innerlinke Debatte und eine Strafanzeige aus. Die Betreiber:innen von Indymedia Schweiz fanden den Text selbst antisemitisch, wollten ihn aber nicht l\u00f6schen.",
                    "In dieser \"Psychodynamik der Eskalation\" seien Freundschaften zerbrochen, schrieb dazu die linke \"Wochenzeitung\". Diese zitierte damals auch einen Verantwortlichen, der behauptete, \"Rassismus\" lasse sich \"grunds\u00e4tzlich nicht mit staatlichen Mitteln\", wie etwa der Antirassismus-Strafnorm, \"bek\u00e4mpfen\". Eine Position, die in der Schweizer Linken 20 Jahre danach wohl kaum mehr jemand \u00f6ffentlich \u00e4ussern w\u00fcrde. Die feministischen und antirassistischen Bewegungen der letzten Jahre haben breit f\u00fcr Diskriminierungsthemen sensibilisiert.",
                    "Trotzdem sp\u00fcren junge, j\u00fcdisch gelesene Linke, bis heute wie antisemitische Muster innerhalb ihres Umfelds an die Oberfl\u00e4che dringen. Anna Rosenwasser labelt sich als \"halb so j\u00fcdisch wie ihr Name klingt\". Darauf angesprochen, sagt die 32-J\u00e4hrige: \"Von Antisemitismus bin ich aber nicht halb betroffen.\" Auf Instagram, wo sie etwa Abstimmungsthemen erkl\u00e4rt und sich zu queeren und feministischen Themen positioniert, folgen ihr 25'000 Menschen.",
                    "Den Antisemitismus, den sie ausserhalb der Linken erlebt, empfindet Rosenwasser als bedrohlicher. Doch Linke stellen h\u00f6here Anspr\u00fcche an sich: \"Dass es in der Linken einen bewussten Umgang mit Antisemitismus braucht, ist f\u00fcr mich klar. In unserer Gesellschaft sind antisemitische Denkmuster verbreitet. Sie zu kennen und zu reflektieren, sehe ich als wichtige antifaschistische Aufgabe.\"",
                    "Dina Wyler sagt, viele Menschen seien \u00fcberzeugt, dass J\u00fcd:innen privilegiert seien und deshalb gar nicht diskriminiert werden k\u00f6nnen. \"Gerade von Linken wird ihnen die Diskriminierungserfahrung oft abgesprochen.\u201c",

                "en_content": "When Amir Malcus drives the stroller, he runs past a left-alternative bar. A shield before it tells: racism is not tolerated, as little as sexism, homophobia and other forms of discrimination. But a term is missing: anti-Semitism. Typically, the 37-year-old social worker finds.\nAlthough Malcus committed himself for many years, he is today disappointed by the left: \"For me it was frustrating to see how widespread anti-Semitism is in the part of society in which I put most hope.\"\nAnti-Semitism is widespread in society \u2013 as in the political left. swissinfo.ch asked Swiss Jews:insides, historians:inside, who accumulate or counterbalance the left, how they experience dealing with anti-Semitism in this environment.\n\nSign up for our newsletter and receive swissinfo.ch's top stories directly in your mailbox.\nAntisemitism belonged to everyday life in the conservative valley where Malcus grew up. In the small groups with which he occupied houses, he was able to explain about anti-Semitic stereotypes, for example, that not all Jews are rich. When he came out of the valley and devoted himself to global themes, he realized that anti-Semitism was not only ubiquitous in his valley.\nAt sessions, he regularly experienced failures against Israel: \"Parols like 'we will burn down your land' were not addressed to me, but I have heard them.\" At demonstrations against the Iraq war or the World Economic Forum WEF, Malcus disturbed the unreflected use of caricatures of capitalists, who often acted as anti-Semitic cartoons.\nA sub-complex capitalism critique is connectable to anti-Semitic world images, in which alleged \"screamers\" indulge in control, and often uses Jewish images with a long tradition. This was demonstrated by the young socialist party Juso, who published a cartoon during a 2016 vote, in which a \"speculant\" was presented as a man with a large nose, cylinder and temple bells.\n\"Antisemitism is a transformative artist,\" says Dina Wyler, who worked until a short time at the foundation against racism and anti-Semitism GRA. \"He always adapts to the applicable narratives and often comes up with image language or encoded words to remain 'salonable'.\"\nThe failures against Israel, which had experienced Malcus in the 2000s, have been part of something that the Swiss left has at least accepted for decades. In his Zurich childhood during World War II in the 1940s, children threw stones to Emanuel Hurwitz and called him anti-Semitic insults.\n\"I have never experienced this obvious anti-Semitism later in the left,\" he says in conversation with swissinfo.ch. After studying, Hurwitz engaged in the Social Democratic Party. He was elected to the parliament of the canton of Zurich, politicized in the left wing. The attitude of the SP to the Middle East conflict was reflected by Hurwitz in the 1970s.\nBut this has changed with the beginning of the Lebanon war, in which Israel appeared as an aggressor. \"From 1982 there was incredible excitement in the SP,\" recalls Hurwitz. He was invited as a Jewish representative in the left to \"countless panel discussions\" which then \"dept as pure propaganda events for the PLO\". \"Israel was evil and the Palestinian PLO has experienced enthusiastic approval.\"\nThe \"hate and fanaticism that broke through it\" surprised him and overwhelmed him. For this demonization he finds only one explanation: \"Anti-Semitism.\" Hurwitz, by profession psychiatrist, at the time tried to explain his genus: how a centuries-old tradition of anti-Semitic prejudices can penetrate the surface in a politically charged situation.\nHis comrades: inside did not want to hear that. On 1 May 1984 Hurwitz returned from Parliament and left the party. It has never come to the debate that SP Zurich promised him nearly 40 years ago. However, since 2019, SP Switzerland has defined antisemitism for itself and its bodies according to the IHRA definition that explicitly includes the forms of antisemitism related to israel. Speaking to swissinfo.ch, Hurwitz said that this late insight of his ex-genesis was already a little vague. In February he died 86 years.\nBerthold Rothschild combined a long friendship with Emanuel Hurwitz. Rothschild politicized in the 1980s in the Communist Party of Labour (PdA). For a long time, the communist: in Israel as a \"heroic nation in the woes of birth\", Rothschild tells. \"Just suddenly it turned.\" Before he \u2013 at a similar time as Hurwitz \u2013 stepped out of the PdA, he has experienced again and again how among communists: stereotypes occurred, for example, that J\u00fcd:inside the left would be betrayed in a doubt.\nRothschild emphasizes the dilemma he still feels in relation to Israel/Palestine: he has very good friends: in those who were long blind to the Jewish hatred of Hizbollah or Hammas. He has always fought for these friendships, but he had already risen abruptly in some appearances and went home. At the same time, he understands that Israeli politics and their dealings with the Palestinians are outrageous \u2013 and the outrage is often justified.\nA friend is on site for the population of Gaza. \"I understand that you become propal anesthetic when you experience this situation. This implies that you become fanatic anti-Israel.\" Anti-Israel is not anti-Semitic. \"But it's not far from it.\" Anti-Semitism, says Rothschild, is unresolved in the left, denied, displaced.\nTo prevent them from falling into anti-Semitic ciphers, these activists have to observe themselves extremely accurately. \"As I am aware of the racism that society gives me, I hope that others are aware that they carry anti-Semitic traits.\"\nSome left friends are so reflected that they present Rothschild flyers or polio texts to test reading: Does the text unintentionally transport anti-Semitic stereotypes? But these are more exceptions.\nAccording to the deputy head of the Center for Jewish Studies at the University of Basel, Erik Petry, the line has to be drawn down by case: \"Oft comes a toxic mixture which is not based on a criticism of the state's policy, but on the assumption that there is an immoral behaviour here that has to do with Jewishism.\" Petry's on the left often experience.\nPolitical opponents: there is also a left anti-Semitism. Historian Christina Sp\u00e4ti observes attempts by some \"right\" politicians: to \"wash\" himself from his own anti-Semitism. But this does not mean that left anti-Semitism does not really exist, says the professor at the University of Fribourg and the FernUni Switzerland.\nIn her dissertation \"Die schweizerische Linke und Israel \u2013 Israel-Environment, Anti-Zionism and Anti-Semitism between 1967 and 1991\", Sp\u00e4ti ordered newspaper reports and incidents in sober language that reveal anti-Semitic resentments in left circles.\nIn 1970, for example, a commentary was published in the Social-Democratic Press, which was toss the kidnapping of Adolf Eichmann by Israel as a \"slag in the face of Argentina\". In the 1980s, the largest leftist newspaper in Switzerland compared Israeli politics with the politics of \"final solution\" \u2013 the Nazi word for the extinction of Jews in Europe.\nLatei offers countless other examples. After all, the commentary on Eichmann's kidnapping led to a shout at the show in 1970. Anti-Semitism was too grotesque in the article. The more subtle incidents did not experience a comparable reaction. Lately comes to the conclusion that there is a \"continuity of the left indifference to anti-Semitism\". While a reflection began in Germany in the 1990s, it remained a taboo in Switzerland, she talks with swissinfo.ch.\nIn recent years, however, in left circles, Sp\u00e4ti has a growing need to deal with anti-Semitism in its own environment. A left-wing activist against anti-Semitism has described swissinfo.ch as in the 1990s, at reconnaissance events on the topic in Zurich, other left-wing, men, with a \"shot into the knee\". At the beginning of 2000, a text and a cartoon on the Indymedia platform triggered an inner-left debate and a criminal complaint. Operators: Indymedia Switzerland found the text itself anti-Semitic, but did not want to delete it.\nIn this \"psychodynamics of escalation\" friendships were broken, the left \"weekly newspaper\" wrote. This also quoted a responsible person who claimed that \"racism\" could not be \"fighted with state resources\", such as the antiracism criminal law. A position that, in the Swiss left 20 years after that, hardly anyone would publicly expose. The feminist and antiracist movements of recent years have been widely sensitized to discrimination issues.\nNevertheless, young, Jewish-read lefts still feel like anti-Semitic patterns within their environment penetrate the surface. Anna Rosenwasser is labeled \"a half as Jewish as her name sounds.\" The 32-year-old says, \"I am not half affected by anti-Semitism.\" On Instagram, where she explains about voting issues and positions herself on queer and feminist issues, 25'000 people follow her.\nRosenwasser feels more threatening to the anti-Semitism that she experiences outside the left. But left-wing claims are higher: \"That in the left it needs a conscious handling of anti-Semitism is clear to me. Anti-Semitic patterns are common in our society. Knowing and reflecting you, I see as an important antifascist task.\"\nDina Wyler says that many people are convinced that Jews are privileged and therefore cannot be discriminated against at all. \"Especially from the left, discrimination experiences are often denied to them. \u2018\nMore\n\nIn crises, many people tend to form anti-Semitic patterns \u2013 for centuries. Switzerland also has a longer history.\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                    "Doch bei der Vision f\u00fcr die Zukunft gibt es Differenzen: Wenn etwa Yaakov Hagoel, Vorsitzender der World Zionist Organization, verk\u00fcndet, dass innert zehn Jahren die Mehrheit der J\u00fcd:innen weltweit in Israel leben solle, fragt sich, ob das auch im Sinn der j\u00fcdischen Diaspora sein kann.

                "en_content": "If you want to go in, military and police will happen from all corners of Switzerland. Then Swiss German becomes rare. The more than a thousand guests, including entrepreneurs: inside and outside the world, have traveled from almost all regions of the world. In addition to Hebrew, English is the transport language. Of the conference stages, two words can be heard particularly frequently, usually as a call: Dreamer! Visionary!\nThe terms sometimes aim at all early Zionists: inside, but mostly on Theodor Herzl. On 29 August 1897 he called to Basel for the first Zionist Congress. Herzl was initiator and then founding president of the World Zionist organization. \"If you want, it's not a dream,\" he wrote: a Jewish state that protects Jewish people from anti-Semitic persecution and discrimination.\n\"If you want, it's not a dream,\" says on 29. August 2022 everywhere on posters and projections. The country is long since real: the state of Israel celebrates its 75th year. Birthday. The country has also arrived in reality, in the contradictions and defeats of everyday life. But Herzl's dream didn't end at the state foundation.\nWith the motto \"Create the past and build a vision for the future\", the host greets the audience on Sunday. The two-day conference is in phase a TED talk event: There are sophisticated speeches that combine a personal story with great ideas. But even at panel discussions there is no room for questions from the audience.\nThis means that possible contradictions are not discussed at least in plenary. Commemoration is unanimous. It is reminiscent of the 2000 years of exile to the destruction of six million Jews in the Shoa. Similarly, many emphasise their concern about the global increase in anti-Semitic attacks and affirm a decisive action against them.\nBut there are differences in the vision for the future: if, for example, Yaakov Hagoel, Chairman of the World Zionist Organization, announces that within ten years the majority of the Jews should live in Israel worldwide, it wonders whether this can also be in the sense of the Jewish diaspora. Of the 15 million Jews in the world today, outside of Israel most live in the USA.\nAfterman Shai, Israel's Minister of Diaspora Suits, focuses more on participation. In Basel, he outlines the plan that Israel should offer Jews and Jews a way of political participation in Israel worldwide.\nRabbi Azman has come to Basel by train \u2013 because there are no flights from Ukraine. \"For Jews who have nothing, Israel means everything,\" says the Chief Rabbi of Ukraine. For those who are now fleeing, the \"Alija\" \u2013 this is the possibility of all Jews and Jewish women to emigrate to Israel \u2013 is of great importance.\nAzman illustrates them on his own example. Over 30 years ago, he left with his wife the falling Soviet Union. When they waited for their connecting flight in Vienna, his highly pregnant woman even got a pineapple from a supporter that she had longed for.\nThe idea of \"Alija\" is older than political Zionism, but decisive for it. Zionist: Inside are convinced that political and social emancipation without Jewish state does not guarantee security. \"In the 19th century, optimistic Jewish thinkers believed that the 'Jewish question', anti-Semitism, would disappear discrimination by emancipation,\" says Israeli success author Micah Goodman in his speech.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to Jews, hate fantasies hardly know borders. Many bellies have emerged in the European Middle Ages.\nAt that time, under the impression of the ideals of enlightenment, the persecution was overcome. Herzl opposed this emancipation promise to the belief that anti-Semitic hatred in Western Europe was suppressed. \"So if emancipation is not the solution \u2013 what is the solution? Zionism is successful where emancipation is condemned to failure.\" This is, according to Goodman, the essence of Herzl's first writing \"The Jewish State\".\nBut in the future Israel and the Jewish diaspora must refer more strongly to Herzl's second influential writing: \"Altneuland\". This could contain the next generation of Zionism. A Zionism that finds \"Jewish solutions for universal problems\". As examples, Goodman calls climate warming and political polarisation, which he sees as a \"social counterpart of climate warming\". The applause on it is frenetic.\n\"Altneuland\", published in 1902, tells the story of a Jewish ideal society in Palestine: democratic, solidarity, equal rights for all. Also for Arab people. So did Goodman encode the Middle East conflict?\nMore\n\n\n\n\nOver all years, the people in Switzerland were in favour of the Zionist movement. With few exceptions.\nThe question must remain open, but it is pushing. For as long as the occupation continues, the Zionist idea will hardly become exemplary beyond the Jewish world. The Middle East conflict is absent and present over a wide range of parts of the conference.\nHe is the elephant in the room as well as Yves Kugelmann in\nsays, but no taboo. In talks with swissinfo.ch, Israeli parliamentarians talk:in Moshe Tur-Paz of the liberal government party and Shirly Pinto of the right government party openly about their perspective on the subject.\nTur-Paz lives in a settlement in the West Bank, whose origin is older than the Israeli state, but which is nevertheless classified by the United Nations as illegal under international law. Tur-Paz says, \"I believe that my ancestors have been promised all Israel. Still, I'm not blind.\"\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland played an important role as a meeting place in the Zionist movement. The 125-year anniversary will be celebrated at the end of August.\nHe sees the Arab population living in the area \u2013 partly with Israeli passport, partly not. Some are his friends. \"As the majority of people in Israel, I live in a sort of solution that lies somewhere between the right of autonomy and one's own country,\" says Knesset's MEP.\nShirly Pinto emphasises that it is crucial to develop the \"Palestinian economy and improve Palestinian life\". With regard to the Arab Israelis, the state must ensure \"that they have everything other people have.\"\nIn two months are elections in Israel. Pinto and Tur-Paz are still members of the same government and emphasize how important it is that an Arab-Islamic party is represented for the first time in their government coalition. Israel is a Jewish state, but it is related to the same rights for all citizens.\nThe words \"Visionary\" and \"Dreamer\" are also mentioned in conversation with Pinto and Tur Paz. \"Zionism is the story of how the Israeli nation dreams of the land of Zion, after 2000 years of exile makes the best. Since the foundation of the state, it means that Jews and Jews from all over the world can orient themselves to Israel,\" says Tur Paz.\nPinto declares that in Israel every contribution to living together is a contribution to Zionism: \"Ob educational work or army service \u2013 everything is part of Herzl's vision.\"\nThe greatest enthusiasm for a lecture is the former Mossad director Yossi Cohen. The Israeli secret service is part of the Zionism realized in Israel, he says. And describes how the Mossad prevented an Iranian nuclear bomb.\nThe final gala later brings light show, fog and pop music. Here the interpretation of Herzl's work then takes some abstract trains. For example, he is compared with the CEO of a startup that helped Israel to succeed in crowdfunding.\nThe Swiss speakers at the Gala, the President of the Basle, Beat Jans and the Federal Council, Guy Parmelin, address the Middle East conflict. Parmelin gets intermediate applause when he speaks for the two-state solution.\nOf course, Israeli President Jitzchak Herzog also refers to Herzl, the forerunner of Zionism, who transferred \"Jewish identity to an effective political doctrine\". A year ago, a \"leading social media platform\" discussed whether the word \"Zionism\" should be treated as an insult because it was abused as an anti-Semitic code. Duke demands on the gala evening: \"We need to get back the term Zionism.\" Regain the interpretation sovereignty and translate it positively.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1930s, the anti-Semitic rush escalated against department stores in Jewish possession \u2013 and the Federal Council banned the expansion of department stores.\nOver the whole jubilee, a great commitment to understand Zionism idealistic, yes utopian. But how the ideal society of Herzl's \"Altneuland\" is to translate into real politics remains open. In contrast to the Dreamer Herzl, the Zionists describe: no empty leaf today.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe Jewish journalist Yves Kugelmann describes his view of the anniversary of the 1st. Zionist Congress \u2013 and the attack on the Palestine Demo.\nMore\n\nAs Switzerland is struggling with its traditional neutrality concept.\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                    "Wann h\u00f6rt ein Provisorium auf, ein Provisorium zu sein? Seit 74 Jahren unterst\u00fctzt das Uno-Hilfswerk UNRWA Pal\u00e4stina-Fl\u00fcchtlinge im Nahen Osten. Finanzielle Schwierigkeiten begleiteten diese Institution dabei st\u00e4ndig. Seit ungef\u00e4hr 2010 hat sich die Situation aber kontinuierlich zugespitzt, da mehrere Geldgeber ihre Beitr\u00e4ge senkten. Ein grosses Loch verursachte insbesondere die zeitweilige Aussetzung der amerikanischen Finanzierung unter dem Ex-Pr\u00e4sidenten Donald Trump 2018, die unter seinem Nachfolger wieder aufgenommen wurde.",
                    "Es klaffe eine L\u00fccke zwischen dem, was von der Organisation erwartet werde, und den Mitteln, die man ihr daf\u00fcr zur Verf\u00fcgung stelle, sagt deren Leiter Philippe Lazzarini. Er hat die Finanzierung der Agentur weit oben auf seiner Priorit\u00e4tenliste, dazu geh\u00f6rt auch \u00d6ffentlichkeitsarbeit. Drastisch warnt Lazzarini: \"Diese wachsende Diskrepanz zwischen Erwartungen und Mitteln k\u00f6nnte zu einer Implosion der Organisation f\u00fchren.\"",
                    "Es w\u00e4re ein Untergang mit Ansage. Die gesprochenen Beitr\u00e4ge stagnieren seit mehr als einem Jahrzehnt \u2013 ein Jahrzehnt, das der Region mehrere Krisen brachte: Der Krieg in Syrien, der Kollaps des Libanon, die Corona-Pandemie, zuletzt das Erdbeben und die erneute Zunahme von t\u00f6dlicher Gewalt in Israel und Pal\u00e4stina. Diese haben die bei der UNRWA registrierten pal\u00e4stinensischen Fl\u00fcchtlinge wiederholt getroffen, und oft ist die Organisation das einzige Auffangbecken f\u00fcr sie. Ohne zus\u00e4tzliche Mittel k\u00f6nne man aber auf die steigenden Bed\u00fcrfnisse nicht reagieren. \"Der Status quo ist schlicht nicht mehr tragbar\", sagt Lazzarini.",
                    "Die UNRWA, das Hilfswerk der Vereinten Nationen f\u00fcr Pal\u00e4stina-Fl\u00fcchtlinge im Nahen Osten, war einst als tempor\u00e4re Organisation gegr\u00fcndet worden, um pal\u00e4stinensische Fl\u00fcchtlinge nach 1948 zu versorgen. Seither wird das Mandat alle drei Jahre verl\u00e4ngert. L\u00e4ngst ist daraus eine Institution entstanden, die staatliche Aufgaben erledigt \u2013 so bietet sie etwa medizinische Versorgung, Bildung und\u00a0Erziehung sowie\u00a0humanit\u00e4re Massnahmen an. Dies f\u00fcr eine registrierte Bev\u00f6lkerung von 5,6 Millionen Menschen in Jordanien, Syrien, dem Libanon und den pal\u00e4stinensischen Autonomiegebieten, die je nach politischer Grosswetterlage in unterschiedlichem Masse darauf angewiesen ist.",
                    "Darunter befinden sich zurzeit 550'000 Sch\u00fcler:innen, jeweils zwei Millionen Menschen sind auf medizinische Erstversorgung oder Nahrungsmittelhilfe angewiesen. Das Spezielle daran: Die rund 30'000 Mitarbeitenden der UNRWA sind gr\u00f6sstenteils selber Pal\u00e4stinenser:innen. Und die Organisation hat nicht nur zunehmend M\u00fche, ihre Hilfsdienste aufrechtzuerhalten, sondern auch deren L\u00f6hne auszuzahlen.",
                    "Da der Fl\u00fcchtlingsstatus vererbt wird, w\u00e4chst die Zahl der Fl\u00fcchtlinge kontinuierlich \u2013 und damit auch die Anforderungen an die UNRWA. Finanziert wird all das \u00fcber freiwillige Spenden. Der Grossteil des Budgets, im Jahr 2022 waren es 1,6 Milliarden Dollar, kommt von westlichen Staaten. Die Schweiz beteiligt sich seit langem mit rund 20 Millionen Franken j\u00e4hrlich.",
                    "Augenf\u00e4llig ist die geringe Beteiligung arabischer Staaten, die zudem in den letzten Jahren abgenommen hat. \"Man sieht eine Diskrepanz: Es wird viel Solidarit\u00e4t mit der pal\u00e4stinensischen Bev\u00f6lkerung ausgedr\u00fcckt, aber gleichzeitig werden immer weniger Mittel gesprochen\", sagt Lazzarini. Das ist Ausdruck der geopolitischen Verschiebungen in der Region: Manche arabischen Staaten wollen ihr Verh\u00e4ltnis zu Israel normalisieren, die schwindende Unterst\u00fctzung der pal\u00e4stinensischen Fl\u00fcchtlinge ist eine Konsequenz davon.",
                    "F\u00fcr die Pal\u00e4stina-Fl\u00fcchtlinge, die in zunehmend schwierigeren Umst\u00e4nden \u00fcberleben m\u00fcssten, habe das nicht nur finanzielle Konsequenzen, sagt Lazzarini: \"Es macht sich vermehrt das Gef\u00fchl breit, von der internationalen Gemeinschaft vergessen worden zu sein.\" Gepaart mit der weit verbreiteten Armut und Perspektivlosigkeit eine gef\u00e4hrliche Mischung.",
                    "Auch die Kritik an der UNRWA hatte in den letzten Jahren zugenommen. Es gab Vorw\u00fcrfe wegen Missmanagement und antisemitischen Inhalten in Schulb\u00fcchern. So sagte der Schweizer Aussenminister Ignazio Cassis nach einem Besuch in einem Lager in Jordanien 2018, die UNRWA sei zu einem \"Teil des Problems\" geworden \u2013 die Organisation sei also bei der L\u00f6sung der Pal\u00e4stinenserfrage ein Hindernis. Ein Narrativ, das insbesondere rechte Gruppierungen in Israel und den USA bereits l\u00e4nger verbreiten.",
                    "Der Vorg\u00e4nger von Lazzarini, der Schweizer Diplomat Pierre Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, musste 2019 seinen Hut nehmen, nachdem er wegen Managementproblemen stark kritisiert wurde. Auch das hatte zu Staus in den Spendenfl\u00fcssen gef\u00fchrt. Europ\u00e4ische Staaten, darunter auch die Schweiz, hatten ihre Zahlungen suspendiert.",
                    "Man nehme Kritik ernst, sagt Lazzarini und verweist auf interne Umstrukturierungen und rigorose Kontrollen des Schulmaterials, das von den Beh\u00f6rden des jeweiligen Einsatzgebiets bereitgestellt wird. \"Aber die UNRWA wird oft f\u00fcr die Probleme in der Region verantwortlich gemacht. Diese k\u00f6nnen jedoch nur auf politischer Ebene gel\u00f6st werden \u2013 und daf\u00fcr gibt es leider schon l\u00e4nger keine Anzeichen\", so Lazzarini.",
                    "Durch die Weiterf\u00fchrung des Fl\u00fcchtlingsstatus und dem Festhalten an das R\u00fcckkehrrecht w\u00fcrden Friedensverhandlungen verunm\u00f6glicht, ist eine oft angebrachte Kritik. Stattdessen solle mehr in die Integration der Fl\u00fcchtlinge im jeweiligen Land investiert werden. \"Die Voraussetzungen dazu gibt es jedoch in keinem dieser L\u00e4nder\", sagt der Leiter des Hilfswerks.",
                    "Unrealistische Erwartungen im Zusammenhang mit der Organisation sind auch Ausdruck der starken Politisierung des Themas. N\u00fcchterne Fehleranalysen und eine Reformierung der Organisation werden teilweise dadurch verunm\u00f6glicht, dass alles durch eine Entweder-oder-Brille gesehen wird: Der Vorwurf einseitig pro-pal\u00e4stinensisch, respektive pro-israelisch zu sein, ist schnell zur Hand.",
                    "Im Jahr 2024 feiert die UNRWA ihr 75-j\u00e4hriges Bestehen. Wie wenig sich manche Dinge ver\u00e4ndert haben, erl\u00e4utert Lazzarini anhand eines k\u00fcrzlichen Besuchs eines Fl\u00fcchtlingslagers in Beirut: \"Nach einem Dreivierteljahrhundert verteilen Sie immer noch Essen\", habe sich ein junger Bewohner an ihn gerichtet.",
                    "Wie also weiter? \"Unser Ziel ist klar: Wir m\u00f6chten eine Situation, in der es die UNRWA nicht mehr braucht\", sagt Lazzarini. Da das Mandat der UNRWA auf Beschl\u00fcssen der Uno-Generalversammlung basiert, kann jede \u00c4nderung der Situation der pal\u00e4stinensischen Fl\u00fcchtlinge nur \u00fcber einen politischen Prozess eingeleitet werden. F\u00fcr den Moment bleibt ihm also nichts anderes \u00fcbrig, als die L\u00fccken zu schliessen und Wege zu finden, die Finanzierung der UNRWA mittelfristig zu stabilisieren.",
                    "Bis eine politische L\u00f6sung gefunden wird, bleibt aber die Organisation unersetzlich, da seien sich alle Akteure einig, sagt Lazzarini. Zumindest aus Israel klingt das anders, auch wenn er die Beziehungen zu den israelischen Beh\u00f6rden als pragmatisch bezeichnet und ein Kollaps der Organisation kaum in deren Interesse sein kann. \"Zurzeit ist in der Region viel in Bewegung. Wir m\u00fcssen optimistisch bleiben, dass eine L\u00f6sung gefunden werden kann \u2013 das sind wir den Pal\u00e4stina-Fl\u00fcchtlingen schuldig.\" Das bedeutet aber auch: Das Provisorium wird auf absehbare Zeit bleiben.",

Financial difficulties were constantly accompanied by this institution. Since about 2010, however, the situation has steadily increased as several donors lowered their contributions. A large hole in particular caused the temporary suspension of American financing under the ex-president Donald Trump 2018, which was resumed under his successor.\nThere is a gap between what is expected of the organization and the resources available to it, says its head Philippe Lazzarini. It has the funding of the agency far above its priority list, including public relations. Drastic warns Lazzarini: \"This growing discrepancy between expectations and resources could lead to an implosion of the organization.\"\nIt would be a decline with announcement. The speeches have been stagnating for more than a decade \u2013 a decade that brought several crises to the region: the war in Syria, the collapse of Lebanon, the corona-Pandemie, the earthquake and the renewed increase in deadly violence in Israel and Palestine. These have repeatedly met the Palestinian refugees registered with UNRWA, and often the organization is the only catching pool for them. Without additional funds, however, one cannot respond to the increasing needs. \"The status quo is simply no longer portable,\" says Lazzarini.\nThe UNRWA, the United Nations Relief Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Middle East, was once established as a temporary organisation to provide Palestinian refugees after 1948. Since then, the mandate has been extended every three years. This has led to the emergence of an institution that performs state tasks, such as medical care, education and education, as well as humanitarian measures. This is the case for a registered population of 5.6 million people in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinian Autonomous Areas, which depends on different levels of political weather.\nThere are currently 550'000 pupils: in each case two million people are dependent on initial medical care or food aid. The special thing about this: the approximately 30,000 UNRWA employees are the largest Palestinians themselves. And the organization has not only increasing efforts to maintain its aid services, but also to pay their wages.\nSince refugee status is inherited, the number of refugees continues to grow \u2013 and thus also the requirements for UNRWA. All this is financed through voluntary donations. The large part of the budget, in 2022 there were 1.6 billion dollars, comes from Western states. Switzerland has been involved for a long time with around CHF 20 million a year.\nThe low participation of Arab states, which has also declined in recent years, is obvious. \"You see a discrepancy: Much solidarity is expressed with the Palestinian population, but at the same time less and less resources are spoken,\" says Lazzarini. This is the expression of the geopolitical shifts in the region: some Arab states want to normalize their relationship with Israel, the devastating support of Palestinian refugees is a consequence of it.\nFor the Palestinian refugees, who would have to survive in increasingly difficult circumstances, this has not only financial consequences, says Lazzarini: \"It is increasingly the feeling that they have been forgotten by the international community.\" Coupled with widespread poverty and lack of perspective, a dangerous mix.\nThe criticism of the UNRWA had also increased in recent years. There were allegations about mismanagement and anti-Semitic contents in school books. After a visit to a camp in Jordan in 2018, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said that the UNRWA had become a \"part of the problem\" \u2013 so the organization was an obstacle in solving the Palestinian issue. A narrative that, in particular, spreads right-wing groups in Israel and the USA for a long time.\nThe predecessor of Lazzarini, the Swiss diplomat Pierre Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, had to take his hat in 2019 after being strongly criticised for management problems. This had also led to congestion in the donations. European states, including Switzerland, had suspended their payments.\nOne takes criticism seriously, says Lazzarini, referring to internal restructuring and rigorous controls of the school material provided by the authorities of the respective field of application. \"But the UNRWA is often blamed for the problems in the region. However, these can only be solved at a political level \u2013 and unfortunately there are no signs for this for a long time,\" says Lazzarini.\nBy continuing refugee status and adhering to the right of return, peace negotiations would be impossible, it is a frequently appropriate criticism. Instead, more should be invested in the integration of refugees in the respective country. \"However, there are no conditions in any of these countries,\" says the head of the aid.\nUnrealistic expectations associated with the organization are also an expression of the strong politicalisation of the topic. Sober error analyses and a reforming of the organization are partially impeded by seeing everything through an either-or-glass: The accusation of being one-sided pro-palaesthetic, or pro-Israel, is quick to hand.\nIn 2024, UNRWA celebrates its 75th anniversary. Lazzarini explains how little things have changed on the basis of a recent visit to a refugee camp in Beirut: \"After a three-quarter century, you still distribute food,\" a young resident addressed him.\nSo what? \"Our goal is clear: we want a situation where UNRWA no longer needs,\" says Lazzarini. Since the UNRWA mandate is based on decisions taken by the UN General Assembly, any change in the situation of Palestinian refugees can only be initiated through a political process. For the moment, he has no other choice but to close the gaps and find ways to stabilise the financing of the UNRWA in the medium term.\nUntil a political solution is found, however, the organization remains irreplaceable, as all actors agree, says Lazzarini. At least from Israel, this sounds different, even if he calls relations with the Israeli authorities as pragmatic and a collapse of the organization can hardly be in their interest. \"At the moment, a lot is moving in the region. We must remain optimistic that a solution can be found \u2013 we owe the Palestine refugees.\" This also means that the Provisional will remain foreseeable time.\nMore\n\nAs Switzerland is struggling with its traditional neutrality concept.\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

We have an alarm and a half minutes to get into a bunker.\nIn the old building where we live, there is no shelter. We're going to the stairwell, we're going as far away from glass as possible. The staircase is the most stable part of a building.\nWhen the Iron Dome sign catches the rocket, you hear a boom. You should wait for ten minutes. Saturday morning we experienced some alarms, then another three in the evening. It's been quieter since then. Just before, I heard a rocket alarm again, but not directly at our quarters.\nRight. The international high-tech company in which I work supports us very much in this situation. We can work if we can. My employees in Israel are currently mostly on-off, because many of them need to care for children at the same time. Friends of a working mate are missing.\nMany of my employees had to enter the army as a reservoir. I'm doing fine. I'm distracted by it, and I'm always on the rumblings, and I'd always expose myself to the pictures in the news and the social media.\nI'm not coming. I'm upset when I see something.\nEven I didn't hear from anyone who lives here and thinks about going. But my colleague at the Swiss Foreign Council seems to have received many calls. For me, it wouldn't be an option to return.\nLike most Swiss in Israel, I am a double citizen. In 2014 I made Alyiah, the Israeli state supports all Jewish people all over the world in the entry and obtaining of citizenship. So I don't think about returning to Switzerland, but I also understand myself as a Swiss, just as a foreign Swiss. That's why I'm in this community too.\nOn the velvet evening we got a helpful mail from the message where we were informed how to log in to the TravelAdmin app. But of course, this was the case with Swiss residents \u2013 not those who make holidays.\nMore\n\nStable land, stable money, stable life plans: In comparison, a lot runs around Switzerland. One factor is the high confidence.\nIt was probably more challenging for tourists. I heard about a corner, some did not know how to get in touch with the message. Of course, it is important that everyone who wants home can be flew out. I find it very difficult. At the moment it seems open whether there are still emergency flights from Switzerland. I'm hardly involved, but I'm trying to be there for Swiss people who live here if they have a problem.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nAttack from nothing: shock and insufficiency also among the nearly 30,000 Swiss who live in Israel.\nSwitzerland must recognize Hamas as a terrorist organization. In the media, I have read that the parliamentary \"Fundschaftsgruppe Schweiz \u2013 Palestine\" stands out. That's good.\nWhat I think is more critical is that no one from the Federal Council has clearly condemned Hamas' attack by Monday afternoon. Maybe it's not because of neutrality, but I think it's questionable.\nReporting is the only thing you can do. You can write us and think about us. In Israel we support each other mentally. But I also get a lot of news from Switzerland and many are also reporting to my parents who live in Switzerland. That's good for my parents, too. The participation is very large.\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

As a journalist, author, presenter and documentaryist, D\u00fcndar was one of the main critical voices of Erdogan's policy - and was therefore targeted by the government. After revealing in 2015 that Turkey illegally provided weapons to Syria, D\u00fcndar was accused of spying and support for terrorism in various processes. After a failed attack (a man shot him outside a court), he left the country in 2016. He was sentenced to heavy fines and his goods in Turkey were confiscated.\nToday he lives in Germany and is editor of the web radio\n. From exile, he continues his struggle for a democratic Turkey. In the interview with SWI swissinfo.ch, he says: \"Freedom of expression is like breathing, how to drink water, how to placate your hunger. Unfortunately, in our country, you have long been unable to breathe, you are thirsty and hungry.\" It is the task of journalism to \"liberate the respiratory tract\".\nOther developments\n\nA milestone in vacilla democracy. Who protects freedom of expression?\nToday Turkey is at a crossroads, says: \"A road leads to an autocratic regime, perhaps even to a dictatorship. The other leads to the establishment of a democracy. A democratic Turkey would be a great opportunity for the region, for Europe and for the whole world.\" And the task of one or a journalist in exile is to work for this, says D\u00fcndar.\nSeries Voices of Freedom from the World",

L'isola si trova a quasi 2'000 chilometri dalla capitale Tokyo e a pi\u00f9 di 1'000 da Kyushu, una delle quattro isole maggiori del Paese. Circa 50'000 persone vivono a Ishigaki, compresa la 28enne Manami Miyara, nata e cresciuta l\u00ec. Nonostante la sua lontananza e le sue dimensioni \u2013 circa una volta e mezzo il Liechtenstein \u2013 Ishigaki si \u00e8 trovata di recente al centro di lotte di potere geopolitiche di livello internazionale nell'Asia dell'est.",
                    "In quanto vicina diretta dell'arcipelago Senkaku, conteso e disabitato, Ishigaki si \u00e8 trovata in prima linea nella lotta per l'influenza geopolitica nel Mar Cinese Orientale. Per questa ragione, le forze di autodifesa del Giappone intendono installare una nuova base sull'isola subtropicale \u2013 una mossa molto contestata che ha spinto gli abitanti, Manami compresa, a far sentire la propria voce.",

Okinawa, formata da una catena di decine di isole che si estendono su una linea lunga quasi 1'000 chilometri, era un regno indipendente fino alla fine del XIX secolo.",

Gli Stati Uniti hanno occupato l'arcipelago per decenni, fino al 1973, quando i giapponesi ne hanno ripreso il controllo.",

Di conseguenza, per la sua situazione geografica remota e il differente percorso storico intrapreso, gli abitanti di Okinawa sono forse pi\u00f9 propensi a far sentire la propria voce attraverso iniziative e referendum rispetto ai connazionali sulle isole maggiori, spiega Manami nel primo video della nostra serie \"Voci di libert\u00e0 dal mondo\".",

The island is located almost 2'000 kilometers from the capital Tokyo and more than 1'000 miles from Kyushu, one of the four largest islands in the country. About 50,000 people live in Ishigaki, including the 28-year-old Manami Miyara, born and raised there. Despite its remoteness and its size \u2013 about once and a half Liechtenstein \u2013 Ishigaki has recently been at the center of international geopolitical power struggles in East Asia.\nAs a direct neighbour to the Senkaku archipelago, disputed and uninhabited, Ishigaki found himself at the forefront of the struggle for geopolitical influence in the East China Sea. For this reason, the self-defense forces of Japan intend to install a new base on the subtropical island \u2013 a very controversial move that pushed the inhabitants, Manami understood, to make their voice heard.\nHowever, there is an even bigger story to tell about the situation the 28-year-old is living. Ishigaki is part of Okinawa Prefecture, today the southernmost part of Japan. Okinawa, formed by a chain of dozens of islands extending on a line almost 1'000 kilometers long, was an independent kingdom until the end of the 19th century.\nIt later became a buffer zone between Japanese and Chinese interests before being annexed from Tokyo in 1879. During World War II, Okinawa was the only battlefield in Japanese territory. The United States has occupied the archipelago for decades, until 1973, when the Japanese regained control.\nFor the people of Okinawa, the problem of military bases is daily bread: about two-thirds of US military facilities in Japan are still concentrated in Okinawa. As a result, due to its remote geographical situation and the different historical path undertaken, the inhabitants of Okinawa are perhaps more likely to make their voice heard through initiatives and referendums than the compatriots on the major islands, explains Manami in the first video of our series \"Voci di libert\u00e0 dal mondo\".\nOther developments\n\nA milestone in vacilla democracy.

They express themselves on large and small, controversial public issues or not. What unites them is the commitment to express themselves freely and, above all, to be heard.\nIn the era of digitalization and global social media, freedom of expression must be defended every day. This is what the voices we heard in our series of short videos \"Voci di libert\u00e0 dal mondo\". In very different conditions and places, in the most diverse contexts, these people fight for freedom of expression.\nOur journey begins in the small Japanese island of Ishigaki, almost 2'000 kilometers south of Tokyo. This is where the 28-year-old Manami Mihara lives.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nA small island 2'000 km from Tokyo has become a centre of direct democracy.\nLet us leave the small Japanese archipelago and speak now of Afghanistan, where the Taliban regime has drastically reduced people's freedom. We meet the young activist Fatima Hadari, in exile in Italy.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nIn Afghanistan, Fatima Haidari led a radio broadcast and worked as a tourist guide. He is now in Italy, where he continues his struggle.\nAbraham Jimenez Enoa lives in Spain, from where he continues to speak of his country of origin, Cuba, whose government practically imposed his exile.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nPrison or exile: it is the choice that the Cuban authorities offered in 2021 to journalist Abraham Jim\u00e9nez Enoa.\nLet's go now to Ireland, where we will know Ellie Kisyombe who managed to make her voice heard as one of the first asylum seekers to run for a public office.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nAfter a long journey from Malawi to Ireland Ellie Kisyombe was the first asylum seeker to apply for a public office.\nFor several years, the socio-political climate in Turkey has become increasingly repressive. Journalist Can D\u00fcndar had to leave the country for this reason. From Germany, he is committed to the democratic future of his homeland.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nFor several years, the socio-political climate in Turkey has become increasingly repressive. Journalist Can D\u00fcndar had to leave the country.\nIn Russia, the situation for the media has deteriorated so much since the invasion against neighbouring Ukraine began, that independent journalists such as the editor-in-chief of the online platform Meduza Galina Timchenko, Russian-Ukraine, now write from the Latvian capital Riga.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nRussian-Ukraine journalist Galina Timchenko has created an online site that continues to write what Russian media can no longer publish.\nMexico is an emerging democracy, but also one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists and journalists. Joel Vera tells us about his experience.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nJoel Vera was forced to close the news portal he was deputy director after the murder of two colleagues.\nWe now know another brave \"Voce della libert\u00e0\": Marie Maurisse publishes the online magazine Gotham City in the Swiss city of Lausanne. Together with his team, he treats economic crimes and is confronted daily with the limits of freedom of press.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nA new law could prevent the media from publishing some critical articles, says the investigative journalist.\nIn Italy more than 20 journalists and journalists live under escort. It is the case of Federica Angeli that we go to meet in Rome.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of the dark side of today's Italy remains dangerous for journalists and journalists, says Federica Angeli.\nContinue to follow and read our articles on the development of freedom of expression in other countries such as India, but also Hungary and Poland, nations that have taken a turn towards authoritarianism in recent years. This is, first of all, bad news for freedom of expression. In these countries, but also in many others, committed and active citizens and citizens do not only suffer restrictions, but also persecutions and, as in Hong Kong, are put in prison.\nDo you know the voices of freedom you'd like to talk to us about? Join the debate!\nOther developments\nDebate\nTell us about the people who fight against autocracy and to whom we should voice in our series on freedom of expression.\nRead more about freedom of expression in our focus:\nOther developments\n\nA milestone in vacilla democracy.

All this has made our resources not enough last year. That is why we have already created five temporary jobs in 2022 and now we will create five more jobs.\nBefore the war in Ukraine, we had 8 people to implement 24 regimes of sanctions. Now we have just over 20. About two thirds work on sanctions against Russia. This is not just legal information and clarification. Even cases where goods are blocked need our intervention. If a company is owned by a person subjected to sanctions, rents and wages must continue to be paid. For all these payments an exemption permit is required by the SECO.\nBe careful not to compare apples and oranges. The SECO has other tasks, equally important, which are carried out by its departments in other countries. Moreover, the number of people is not decisive, it is also a matter of quality. They serve experts and experts in compliance. Other countries, for example the United Kingdom, have difficulty finding enough competent persons.\nOther developments\n\nSwitzerland carries out a dangerous game of balancing with the EU from which it could be defeated.\nWe see her differently. The resources were practically tripled, just like in other countries. The European Commission employs 25 people for sanctions.\nBesides, SECO is not the only one that deals with the implementation of sanctions. We have the support of the State Secretariat for International Financial Issues (SFI), the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAE), the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), the Public Ministry of the Confederation, the Ministry of Migration Status (SEM) and others.\nWe don't think a task force would improve efficiency. It would change the label. The same people would be involved.\nWe must implement measures in both sectors. There are many speculations about the size of patricians in Switzerland. It is important to distinguish between unsanctioned goods and frozen goods. We were almost the first in the world to provide figures. The banks have a blocking obligation: they must freeze the goods and then communicate it to the SECO.\nI would say yes, although of course I cannot guarantee that there are no black sheep. But yes, today Swiss banks are very careful.\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to receive our articles.\nBanks know, but we can't know. It should be stressed that media coverage focuses on people and sanctioned funds. But the regulation provides for other measures, such as prohibitions of technology and services or restrictions on the export of goods, which work well and can be more effective to weaken the military capabilities of Russia that allow it to continue its war in Ukraine.\nTrustees and legal studies are subject to the obligation to report in case of sanctions. The only cases where there is no such reporting obligation are those where there is a suspicion of money laundering, but you are trying to extend the law to these professional groups as well. We are also discussing the introduction of a register of actual company owners. This could help, but it will not be the magic wand.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nMelissa Parke, the new ICAN executive director, talks about the challenges to overcome for a future without nuclear weapons.\nIt's pure fantasy. It was first sanctioned by the EU and then also by Switzerland. And also the wife, first from the EU and later from us. In the United States and the United Kingdom, instead, he is sanctioned and she is not.\nWe are aware of these companies and have requested information. It is important to understand the idea of the price ceiling: It is not a trade ban, but a roof at the price. The aim is to maintain global energy supplies without Russia being able to finance war with the resulting profits.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nWestern sanctions imposed on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine caused a stir in global oil trade.\nThe idea is G7.\nThey have the same obligation to report assets that have banks, for example, but for the rest they do not have reporting obligations. In the EU, this aspect is regulated exactly the same way. There is also a EU recommendation on transaction documentation, not legally binding, to which we refer.\nWe follow the reports of partner states or media, for example. It follows a complex procedure.\nAlso this is a falsehood. We specifically follow the indications from various sources. Other countries also act like this. We proceed on the basis of risk. It doesn't make much sense to want to control all reports or all financial intermediaries. Nobody does.\nWe are in contact with companies, we have customs statistics and reports coming to the Communications Office on money laundering (MROS). People acting as financial intermediaries are obliged to make these reports, even in the case of violations of sanctions that constitute a possible crime for money laundering.\nToday we exchange figures and documents weekly, especially with the EU, but it also works well with the United States. If Switzerland is to be officially part of an international task force, it is more than a political question.\nIt would be a massive violation of fundamental rights. It is hardly conceivable in a rule of law. It is a theme similar to that of the possible confiscation of frozen goods. I do not say that it would be absolutely impossible for Switzerland, but it would require an internationally agreed legal basis and, in individual cases, people affected should have the right to defend themselves legally.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland must change its mindset about transparency, says Tom Keatinge.\nArticles mentioned\nSeries Switzerland and sanctions against Russia\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

After the invasion of Ukraine, the chairman of the committee Thomas Bach had initially recommended to exclude completely Russian athletes and athletes from sports competitions, and then back off, proposing instead their participation under neutral flag.\nRussia, for its part, threatens to launch similar sports competitions with China, Brazil, India or South Africa, while Ukraine announced its refusal to participate in the Olympic Games in Paris in 2024 if Russian athletes and athletes will be present.\nBach fears that international sport is divided into two political blocks. He recently stated that \"the universal Olympic Games would no longer be possible\".\nA year after the next Olympics, what should the CIO do to avoid taking a road without exit? Does its principle of neutrality prevail over the interests of Ukrainian sports and sportsmen? In an interview with SWI swissinfo.ch, Patrick Clastres, historian of Olympicism at the University of Lausanne, talks about the CIO hesitation and the risks of a schism of international sport.\n: This is the third time Vladimir Putin has been drinking the Olympic Truce: the destabilization and dismemberment of Georgia took place during the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008, the annexation of Crimea during the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014 and the military invasion of Ukraine, on 24 February 2022, just four days after the end of the Winter Olympic Games in Beijing.\nCertainly international condemnation in this last case was much more intense. In addition, Putin's project to rebuild the former Russian Empire has become so clear that it poses a threat to the Baltic States, Poland, Moldova and Finland.\nOther developments\n\nSwitzerland carries out a dangerous game of balancing with the EU from which it could be defeated.\nThomas Bach must also deal with the pressures that numerous athletes and athletes and Olympic leaders from Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, Norway and Sweden exercise through social media. Those who are in Switzerland, France and in the peninsular states of Europe have a low profile: is it due to respect for sports neutrality, or should it be considered a sign of bad health of democracy?\n\"The CIO is under pressure from international sports sponsors, who do not want to risk being associated with war. \"\nReturning to the CIO, it also undergoes the pressure, little visible but decisive, of the sponsors of international sport, who do not want to risk being associated with war. The decision of 2022 allowed the CIO to benefit, in a second time, of the loss of Russian influence within many international sports federations. We do not forget that Bach was taken for the nose by the institutionalized doping system introduced in Russia between 2011 and 2015 and the consequent destruction of evidence and information.\nFour days after the invasion of Ukraine, Bach asked the federations to exclude athletes and athletes from Russia and Belarus from competitions, to put an end to international competitions within these two countries and to suspend their sports leaders from every international mandate. He did so in the name of the Olympic Truce, proclaimed by the UN General Assembly, which begins two weeks before the Games and ends two weeks after their end. The sports federations immediately aligned - except those of shooting, boxing, sambo and judo, whose leaders are close to Putin.\nAnnouncing last January of wanting to \"try a way\" to reintegrate Russian and Belarusian athletes and athletes in international sports competitions, Bach surprised some people. In fact, it was the answer to an urgency: allow athletes and athletes of these two countries to participate in the qualifying for the Paris Olympics, in case the war ended before summer 2024.\nTime holds for the CIO, if you want to remain the incarnation of Olympic universalism. In the face of the reticence of various national Olympic Committees (CON) European, it has made it known that the Asian Association of CON has been prepared to welcome athletes and athletes of Russia and Belarus in their competitions to allow their possible qualification.\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to receive our articles.\nCompared with the reactions indignant to the declaration of 25 January, at least in the West, Bach wanted to clarify the position of the IOC without jeopardizing a future decision on the Paris Olympics. By extending financial aid to the Ukrainian CON, he asked the federations to verify that people with Russian or Belarusian passport participated in the races only individually (so not in team sports, which would incarnate the nation), and under neutral flag (no banner, coat of arms, anthem, no presence in medals and carrying only white or monochromatic clothing).\nHe added three conditions: that athletes and athletes fulfilled all the rules of the World Anti-Doping Code, which did not actively support the war in Ukraine and that they were not under contract with the army or security services. This has demonstrated the ability of the IOC to imagine completely unpublished diplomatic solutions.\nAlthough the last two conditions have been judged discriminatory by one of the two experts of the United Nations requested by the IOC, they are proportional to the ultimate purpose: do not deprive the Olympic Games of athletes and athletes who have no responsibility in the war.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nMelissa Parke, the new ICAN executive director, talks about the challenges to overcome for a future without nuclear weapons.\nThe result was a cacophony of reactions: the majority of the federations followed the indications of the IOC, with differences in the reactions that betrayed a certain Russian influence, while others (atletics, badminton, riding, climbing, surfing) rejected them.\nIt is not sure that many athletes and athletes from Russia and Belarus will qualify for Paris 2024. In order to avoid the detachment of a reduced Olympic delegation to the bone, Putin may decide not to send an athlete. The CIO would thus maintain neutrality, while avoiding a boycott of the Games by Ukraine and its allies.\nThe Ukrainian government plays its role using this threat as a tool for sports \u201csoft power\u201d. The response of the IOC seems to be an agitated embrace that betrays the discomfort in the face of this diplomatic dilemma.\nIs it possible to imagine, for Paris 2024, the absence of Ukraine and the presence of Russia and Belarus, even if under neutral flag? The CIO's response is to say that Olympic universalism would no longer make sense if the 70 countries currently living a war situation were excluded from the Games, or if the Olympics were to be limited to the democracies alone, which are, in fact, minority in the world.\nIn fact, the vast majority of current conflicts are civil wars and latent border. A war of annexation such as Russia is a unique case, especially in Europe, which has already been the epicenter of two world wars.\n\"Olympic universalism would make no sense if it were to be limited [...] to the only democracies that are, in fact, a minority in the world. \"\nAlthough democracies are a minority in the world, this does not justify the failure to denounce human rights violations, whose universalism is denied by regimes supporting Russia. Everything depends on which side the CIO wants to be.\nSome voices criticize how those who ask for sanctions use two weights and two measures. For example, the exclusion of the United Kingdom and the United States from the Olympic Games at the time of the war in Iraq, which was conducted in a manner not in conformity with international law. In this way it is neglected that many people and a part of Western politics had opposed that war.\nTo avoid two weights and two measures, it is up to the IOC to adopt clear rules, expressing itself in favour of the exclusion from the Olympic Games of any country that conducts a war of annexation and inserting in its statute binding rules for the participation of athletes and athletes of the countries in question. The CIO can thus fully rediscover its founding mission of promoting international peace through sport.\nThe reverse of course of the CIO is explained with its ancient fear of seeing rise international competition organizations.\n\"The reversal of the IOC is explained with its ancient fear of seeing rise international competition organizations. \"\nIt is true that Russia is using its sports diplomacy to hire this type of iron arm. In June 2022, Russian Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin, former president of the International Federation of University Sports, traveled to India to extend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) to the sports industry. Established in 2001 for economic and strategic purposes from China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, this organization can be seen as a counterpart to the OECD and NATO.\nIndia and Pakistan joined it and Iran, Belarus, Afghanistan and Mongolia will soon be added. Matytsin also established links with South Africa, Brazil, Bosnia, Mali, Peru and some Gulf States, to the point of suggesting that SCO is extending to the global South for sport.\nPutin and Matytsin recently invited SCO sports ministers to send their athletic delegations to the Ekaterinburg University Sports Festival in August 2023, to the Friendship Games scheduled in Kazan immediately after the Paris Olympics, and to the next Russian-Islamic World Forum. In 2024, the world of sport could therefore be divided into two, with the Olympic Games of liberal democracies on one side and the \"Amicizia Games\" of authoritarian regimes on the other. This is what President Bach wants to avoid, although perhaps he is leaving the impression of turning back.\nThe subject of the necessary neutrality of international sports organizations has already been raised in history, for example during the Berlin Games. In August 1936, while Germany was preparing for war, Hitler declared: \"The sport and cavalry competition awakens the best human qualities. It does not separate, but unites opponents in mutual understanding and respect. It also contributes to strengthening the bonds of peace between nations. May the Olympic flame never turn out.\"\nThe then President of the CIO, the Belgian Count Henri de Baillet-Latour, concluded: \"Berlin was the meeting place of all peoples, and a unity emerged from it without which one could never reach peace or happiness.\" Refused to revoke the organization of the Games to the Third Reich, as millions of people at the time demanded for peace and democracy on both sides of the Atlantic, the CIO served Hitler's cause. It is an indelible stain on its history, which so far did not want to face.\n\"Refusing to revoke the organization of the 1936 Games from the Third Reich [...], the CIO served Hitler's cause.\"\nStaying out of political discourse means allowing Olympic universalism to become the Trojan horse of those who oppose peace and human rights. Armed with this lesson in history, the IOC must learn to choose to place itself on the side of peace, which is indissolubly linked to freedom and human rights.\nIn a way, his fortune lies in the fact that he is not modeled on the United Nations, with a General Assembly in which each country has a vote and a Security Council that can block initiatives through veto law. Thanks to the recruitment for co-option, which is not democratic, the CIO could well elect its members among the sports leaders who fight for freedom, instead of allowing authoritarian regimes to impose their choices.\nIt would thus become a fully autonomous institution, acting as a democratic and peaceful guard dog for the sports world, avoiding athletes and athletes to take political risks. Only on this condition could the CIO one day be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

Solo dall'inizio della guerra, nel febbraio 2022, sono giunte in Svizzera 75 tonnellate, secondo i dati dell'Ufficio federale della dogana e della sicurezza dei confini (UDSC).",

Poi, le quantit\u00e0 sono esplose: dal 2019 fino allo scoppio della guerra, la Russia ne ha venduto a Londra oltre 700 tonnellate, per un valore di oltre 34 miliardi di franchi, secondo le statistiche ufficiali britanniche\u00a0per il commercio estero.",
                    "L'esperto svizzero di metalli preziosi Bernhard Schnellmann spiega cos\u00ec l'aumento: \"La banca centrale russa ha smesso di acquistare oro a met\u00e0 2019 e poi ha soppresso l'IVA sull'oro\". Di conseguenza le esportazioni aurifere sono fortemente aumentate.\u00a0",

A joint research of the Rundschau broadcast of the German-speaking Swiss Television SRF and the weekly\nshows that in recent years the Swiss gold refineries have worked large amounts of Russian gold from London.\nSince 2021, 110 tons of precious metal, worth more than six billion francs, have passed through foundries located in the Confederation. Only from the beginning of the war, in February 2022, 75 tons arrived in Switzerland, according to the data of the Federal Office of Customs and Security of the borders (UDSC).\nStatistics show a strong increase in Russian gold imports in Switzerland. Before the war, every year the Confederation imported only about 20 tonnes on average. As a comparison, only in the first five months of this year, there were 38 tonnes, passing from London.\nThe path of Russian gold passes from the UK. Until 2018, the country exported very little gold. Then, the quantities have exploded: from 2019 until the outbreak of the war, Russia has sold more than 700 tons to London, worth more than 34 billion francs, according to British official statistics for foreign trade.\nThe Swiss expert on precious metals Bernhard Schnellmann explains the increase: \"The Russian central bank stopped buying gold in mid-2019 and then suppressed the gold VAT.\" As a result, aurifer exports are strongly increased.\nThe former professor of criminal law and gold trade expert Mark Pieth has a different explanation. The expert sees us a clear connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine: \"I assume these sales served to prepare the war,\" he says.\nFor Pieth, therefore, there is suspicion that Russia may have filled its war chest with massive gold exports. In addition to revenue from gas and oil sales, gold could thus have helped finance the war of aggression against Ukraine.\nThe fact that this gold was supposedly worked in Switzerland is problematic, according to Pieth, although at this time the Russian regime would not be profiting from transactions. \"If now the Swiss refineries imported this gold and renamed it, it would not be legally problematic. But it would be ethically very questionable,\" says Pieth.\nMarc Ummel, an expert in raw materials at the old Swissaid, also underlines this aspect. Because with recasting, \"Russian gold and ethically questionable\" becomes gold with the Swiss quality brand. \"You lose traceability, which is very problematic,\" he says.\nGold refineries in Switzerland do not see any connection between the processing of gold of Russian origin and the war activities of the Kremlin. We contacted him, Christoph Wild, president of the Swiss Association of Manufacturers and traders of precious metals, states that \"this gold is not subject to sanctions and has nothing to do with ethics. It was produced before the beginning of the war.\"\nAs long as it can be shown that it is gold exported from Russia to the United Kingdom before the war and therefore the beginning of sanctions, Wild does not see any ethical problem in its processing. \"This is not a forced disappearance of Russian gold,\" he says.\nIn Switzerland there is a ban on \"purchase, import or transport\" gold from Russia. The Federal Council decided in August 2022.\nAs for the gold of Russian origin imported in Switzerland in recent years, UDSC states that \"it's all legal\" and that imports have been controlled. Gold originally came from Russia, but had already been exported to the United Kingdom before the war began in Ukraine in February 2022. It does not come directly from Russia and does not serve to directly finance the war.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nTicino is an important centre of trade in steel products from Eastern Europe.

Occorre quindi affrontare la questione della vendita a Paesi terzi attraverso i quali i prodotti potrebbero arrivare in Russia, cosa che sta chiaramente accadendo.",
                    "Ci sono aziende in Svizzera, Regno Unito, Germania e Francia che hanno visto aumentare le vendite a Paesi terzi non allineati dall'anno scorso. Queste aziende dovrebbero chiedersi perch\u00e9 queste vendite sono aumentate e se possono essere collegate all'elusione delle sanzioni russe - \u00e8 ingenuo pensare che non lo siano.",

                "en_content": ": Switzerland is in an interesting position. It is a legal order that will remain guilty in the eyes of the world at least for another generation. So, I think I have to do everything and more to convince people who are on the good side and prove their innocence.\nThe Confederation has been subjected to pressure by the G7, but is also in a difficult position because, to some extent, it has decision-making power in Brussels. I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he is a member of the Committee on Budgets. This inevitably leads to a discrepancy, as it may end up having to implement measures with which it does not agree.\nWithout a register on transparent companies, the ability to implement sanctions is significantly reduced. How can a country ensure that there is no link between a sanctioned person and a company operating in its jurisdiction if it does not have all the information? The media will quickly find a connection. This is a valuable service that the media industry has done for several years.\nI think that a good register of companies - to quote a colleague in Latvia - is the \"saving platform to rely on if you want to be sure of the implementation of sanctions\". Without a decent register, people of their innocence cannot be persuaded. We can discuss whether the register should be public or not, but if the authorities do not have access to certain information, then they cannot do their best to implement sanctions.\nSwitzerland was submitted to the anti-money laundering evaluation by the International Financial Action Group (GAFI) long ago, before the Panama Papers. Since 2016, GAFI has introduced higher standards. So, a country that has been assessed last year must meet higher demands than what Switzerland has done.\nThe Confederation will have to face a great test when it is again assessed in the coming years. What will you do from here to then to make sure you have increased your standards in line with the expectations of GAFI? He can't say: \"We did good ten years ago.\" I think Switzerland has to look forward, not back.\nHowever, it is important to remember that the GAFI standard is a minimum standard. A country that is content to meet the minimum standards arouses the suspicion of being a country that facilitates the adjustment of sanctions.\nOther developments\n\nLike many other developed countries, Switzerland is confronted with an important shortage of personnel in many sectors.\nFrankly, you must be. As already mentioned, Switzerland is paying - wrongly or rightly - a certain reputation of secrecy and opacity. Employing actively in the regime of sanctions, demonstrating that it is freezing goods and exploiting national skills (e.g. in commodity trade and private banking) to press the Russian economy, will help to remove the suspicions that still surround its financial integrity.\nThe sanctions are agreed in Brussels, but this is only the framework. Each country has its own law of implementation. The result is that there are different definitions for terms such as ownership and control. Most states say that if a sanctioned person has a share of more than 50% of a certain entity, this must be subject to sanctions, but the interpretation of control (when a person controls but does not own a company) differs between one country and another. This lack of harmonization causes fouls that can be exploited.\nIt is also important to say that banks have long been sensitive to the issue of the implementation of sanctions, because they themselves have had trouble with US justice, but European companies have very little experience in implementing sanctions. Companies active in commodity trade had to think about it a bit in the past, but not at current levels with Russia.\nSpeaking with lawyers and consultants, they will tell you that they still have customers who are trying to continue the business where they are not subject to sanctions. There are those who say that companies must do \"the right thing\", regardless of whether sanctions are in force or not. But what does it mean in the business world to do the right thing?\nI have some understanding for companies that say: \"You may not like what we are doing from an ethical point of view or reputation, but we are operating in compliance with the law. Our lawyers approved what we're doing. If the law changes, we will change our way of acting.\"\nWhat I like to ask politicians and policies is: what should be changed in the implementation of sanctions against Russia? What are the steps to make this change? The simplest answer could be that all trade with Russia or with the intermediary countries that sell to Russia should be reset. And then we discuss the possibility of granting some exemptions, for example for drugs.\nMy idea is that the allies of Ukraine must act to prevent the Kremlin from financing and supplying its armed forces. If this is our goal, we must ensure that sanctions on products such as high-tech electronics are as unattachable as possible.\nBut we also know that Russia is moving from a civil economy to a military and war economy. The factories producing buses now produce tanks. We must therefore consider how much the embargo should be. It is therefore necessary to address the question of sale to third countries through which products could arrive in Russia, which is clearly happening.\nThere are companies in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Germany and France who have seen increased sales to non-aligned third countries since last year. These companies should wonder why these sales have increased and if they can be linked to the elusion of Russian sanctions - it is naive to think that they are not.\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to receive our articles.\nWe must ensure that the private sector is smarter and reflects what it is doing, rather than merely observing the rules.\nNot adhering, it further damages its reputation. Why should Switzerland not join? Some people think the country has something to hide.\nIf I were Switzerland at this time, I would find an area where the country is well known and I would try to understand how to show global leadership in the implementation of sanctions against Russia in that field.\nIf it were the raw material trade sector, I would do four to collaborate with companies like Glencore and Trafigura to help them understand the sanctions and consult them on what changes they would feel useful to achieve change.\nI would do a virtue. I would organize a conference on the implementation of sanctions against Russia in the field of commodity trade, sponsored by Glencore and Trafigura, and invite allied partners to brainstorm on how to develop this particular element of the sanction network.\nI hope so, but it is clear that the main allies think otherwise. Switzerland should take seriously the concerns raised by G7 members. For many, Switzerland will remain guilty until it proves categorically innocent.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe arrival of new pests and the gradual withdrawal of the most toxic products force Europe to temporarily authorize prohibited products.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nAre criticisms of Switzerland for the implementation of sanctions against Russia justified? Erwin Bollinger, from SECO, answers.\nArticles mentioned\nSeries Switzerland and sanctions against Russia\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

                "en_content": "The modest offices of Solway Investment Group in the city of Zugo, in central Switzerland, do not give the impression it is a powerful mining giant. The seven-storey building, which houses a fifteen-story Solway employees on the sixth floor, is typical of Zugo. There is a Solway administrative office, which enjoys interesting tax rates, discretion and economic stability for which Switzerland is known.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nBern has always been reluctant to pass laws to force companies to unveil the real owners. The sanctions against Russia will perhaps be a turning point.\nHere it is easy not to be noticed, and this is convenient to Denis Gerasev. One of the only two members of the board of directors of the group, Gerasev, who also manages the legal office, has never released an interview with the media in his 15 years of work in the company.\nWith a dark sweater and casual pants, Gerasev offers some personal details: the paintings leaning on the wall of his office overlooking Lake Zugo were made by his wife and 7-year-old daughter, who live with him in Ober\u00e4geri, a picturesque town on the lake; once he was a motorcycle fan, but he gave up when he became a father.\nFaced with a press officer, Gerasev prepared himself for the interview with copious notes, which is not surprising given what he and the company face. In November 2022, the US Treasury Department\nSolway as a Russian company and sanctioned two employees and two subsidiaries under Magnitsky law, following charges of corruption and Russian influence in the Guatemalan mining industry.\nThe U.S. Treasury did not explain why it defined Solway a Russian company and did not respond to requests for further information from SWI swissinfo.ch.\nSolway, founded two decades ago, is facing an uphill road to defend itself against the accusations of the US Treasury, partly because of its tradition of secrecy, despite its global presence ranging from Indonesia to Ukraine and Guatemala.\nLast November, the Office for Foreign Asset Control at the US Treasury Department (OFAC) sanctioned two Solway employees and two subsidiaries in Guatemala under the Magnitsky Law, which affects citizens and foreign citizens responsible for human rights abuses and corruption. The U.S. Treasury accused the two employees \u2013 a Russian citizen and a Belarusian \u2013 of orchestrating for several years multiple corruption schemes involving politicians, judges and government officials.\nIn his\n, the OFAC has defined Solway Investment Group \"a Russian company that has exploited the mines of Guatemala since 2011\" and said that an employee \"has conducted acts of corruption to promote Russian influence schemes, illegally escalating cash payments to public officials in exchange for support of Russian mining interests\".\nThis took place about eight months after an important media investigation, which involved 65 journalists and journalists and was based on a massive data leak, said that the Guatemalan subsidiaries of the company had tried to silence the leaders of indigenous communities, who had denounced the alleged environmental damage caused by mining projects. The survey raised other reports of suspicious financial transactions between companies connected with Solway and its managers. The company rejected the charges, stating that they were devoid of concrete foundations, and opened an investigation to make clarity.\nOn the website of the company, on Wikipedia and in the registers of the enterprises of Cyprus, Malta and Switzerland there are fragments of information, but there is no clear story about the origins of the company and who has the final control. The group drew the attention of the U.S. authorities following a series of news spread by the media, including a massive survey published by broadcasters such as the\nin March 2022. According to this inquiry, the Guatemalan subsidiaries of the company would have hidden pollution reports and tried to force silence leaders of local communities.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe Solway Investment Group has suspended the activities of two nickel extraction subsidiaries in Guatemala due to US sanctions.\nSolway's involvement in highly sought after minerals and metals, such as nickel used in electric car batteries, makes it increasingly difficult to stay in the shade.\nA recent\nsuggested that the US government is trying to exploit Treasury sanctions to ensure access to Solway's mining activities in Guatemala, in the context of an intense competition with China for strategic resources.\n\"We have never tried to hide anything,\" says Gerasev, stating the group's secrecy statements, despite the lack of information on his website and his reticence to confront the media. The website does not refer to Gerasev and does not present a history of company history. It only indicates that Solway has 5,000 employees, but there are no photos of executives or managers.\nAs a private company, Solway has no obligation to provide any details. There are no shareholders or shareholders who ask for transparency, nor authorities who are obliged to publish the methods of selection of members of the Board of Directors or compensation.\n\"Solway is a family business and has always been,\" says Gerasev at SWI swissinfo.ch. \"It was founded in 2002 by Aleksander Bronstein, a Estonian businessman. The aim of the company was to invest in metals and mines worldwide. \"\nLike many companies in Switzerland, Solway has used a complex corporate structure that makes it difficult to verify its origins or actual properties \u2013 those who ultimately have the income or property rights of the company, or the ability to control its activities. The company was established in Cyprus, known to offer foreign investment a high degree of anonymity.\nIn 2015 Solway moved to Switzerland, Gerasev explains, because it is a well-known center for mining and raw materials. The interesting tax rate and the stability of legislation were also decisive factors.\nThe media survey found hundreds of transactions between 23 companies linked to Solway or its management between 2007 and 2015. Gerasev does not confirm the number of companies, but says that \"there is nothing unusual about this. Companies often use so-called special vehicles for various investments. It is normal that there is more than one society in a group.\"\nThe cantonal register of Zugo is named after Gerasev and the son of Bronstein, Dan Bronstein, who, according to Gerasev, is the managing director of the company. In the register there are three other Solway entities, two of which, according to the company, are branches.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nWestern sanctions imposed on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine caused a stir in global oil trade.\nGerasev confirms that the main shareholder of Solway Investment Group is Solway Holding Malta, information also available on the company's website and in the Zugo cantonal register. In the Malta Business Register, three persons with executive roles and four shareholders, who are companies registered at one address in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\"The inclusion of these entities in the corporate scheme had the sole purpose of harmonizing corporate governance,\" says SWI swissinfo.ch, a press officer of Solway in an email. \"These entities will soon be excluded from the property as a result of the effort to simplify the business structure.\" The Press Officer then confirms that there are 43 direct and indirect subsidiaries of the holding company registered in Malta.\nThe final owners \u2013 according to Gerasev are the sons of Aleksander Bronstein, both German citizens \u2013 are not mentioned either in the register of Malta's enterprises or in the register of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The Malta Register office rejected SWI swissinfo.ch's request for documentation, stating that the \"actual property register is limited to the competent authorities and persons involved as defined in the regulations on the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing\".\nA little more than a week before the publication of this article, Solway's legal team shared with SWI swissinfo.ch an extract from the Malta register, from which it turns out that children, Christian and Dan Bronstein, are the actual owners with 60% and 40% of the shares, respectively. The company did not grant SWI swissinfo.ch permission to publish the document in the light of an EU court ruling limiting public access. A company's press officer states that he considers \"potentially dangerous the publication of a document containing personal data of shareholders, both for those who own companies and their families, and for the company itself\"\nQuestions about Solway's ties with Russia go beyond property. Gerasev is a Russian citizen who obtained Israeli citizenship in 2014. Before moving to Switzerland in 2015, Gerasev lived in Moscow but \" grew up in several countries, including the Soviet Union, the United States and France\".\nAn archive of the company's website on the Internet shows that Solway, which was previously called the Solway Investment Fund, had a representative office in Moscow and expressed pride in his expertise on the Russian economy. Alexander Bronstein was a citizen of the Soviet Union before becoming Estonian, but he never had a Russian passport. From 2003 to 2007\nof the Siberian-Urals Aluminum Company, founded by the Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, who eventually merged with two other aluminum companies.\nMany and many Solway employees are of Russian nationality, but an even greater number comes from Ukraine, according to Gerasev. Russian is also the \"de facto frank language of the company\" because many people working there come from the former Soviet republics.\n\"Having some Russian managers and some people who speak Russian does not mean that the company is Russian, nor is it somehow linked to oligarchs, Kremlin or regime. That's not the same,\" Gerasev says.\nHe insists that the company is not affiliated with the Russian state. This impression was created by the media in 2014 and maintained.\n\"We have a very important branch in Ukraine, called Pobuzhsky\", says Gerasev, referring to an iron-nickel manufacturer. \"When Crimea was annexed by Russia, there was an attempt by some businessmen to take control of our Ukrainian assets and this was done with a defamatory campaign that called Solway a Russian company, because since 2014 Russian companies were not welcome in Ukraine.\" SWI swissinfo.ch has managed to find some reports of media that speak of an attack on the Ukrainian branch.\nOther developments\n\nLike many other developed countries, Switzerland is confronted with an important shortage of personnel in many sectors.\nSolway\nall its projects in Russia, in particular the gold mining operations \u201cKurilgeo\u201d and \u201cZGRK\u201d, in March 2022, shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, because they were \u201cincompatible with the strategy of the group\u201d, says Gerasev. Solway was also publicly expressed against the war in Ukraine and was forced to\nafter a Russian missile attack destroyed a nearby power station.\nSix days after the interview with SWI swissinfo.ch, the company released\nwith the first results of an announced \"independent investigation\" on U.S. charges that led to the sanctions of its Guatemalan subsidiaries, stating that \"though there are connections between Solway, its founder, and commercial entities and Russian individuals, there is no evidence that Solway, its founder or people holding actions have historically, or are currently, controlled or influenced by Russian entities and/or individuals in any way\".\nThe combination of sanctions against Solway's subsidiaries, the war in Ukraine and the multiple media investigations are weighing on the company.\n\"We are operating in a crisis mode,\" Gerasev said. \"It is very important for us to remove the branches from the sanctions list as soon as possible.\"\nIn addition to the financial impact of the blocking of production both in Guatemala and Ukraine, the company is also facing greater control by customers and partners. Last July, Solway and the Salzburg Festival interrupted a sponsorship partnership after the company was unable to fully dissipate human rights abuse charges in Guatemala. The company continues to reiterate that such charges were based on false or imprecise information.\nSolway is slowly improving its transparency, although selectively. Since March 2022, he has published several press releases on his environmental, social and governance commitments, including a human rights policy. Gerasev also stated that an update of the company\u2019s administrative structure is planned to include a wider board of directors.\nThe world is changing, as well as expectations on our sector, says Gerasev. \"We didn't think we weren't transparent, but yes, we will improve.\"\nArticles mentioned\nSeries Switzerland and sanctions against Russia\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

                "en_content": "A letter of early April subjugated Switzerland. In their message, ambassadors from the G7 countries in Bern accused the Federal Council of not doing enough to implement sanctions against the Russian oligarchy.\nIt is interesting to note that the letter does not mention banks, but focuses on lawyers and lawyers, as well as on the very wide provisions of the country regarding data protection.\nIt's no coincidence. While banks have adopted a decisive strategy called \"white money\", which provides for the automatic exchange of information, for some years Swiss law firms have been the subject of recurring criticism, both in Switzerland and abroad. And that for good reasons.\nIt is not the first time since the beginning of the war in Ukraine that Switzerland is subject to such criticism of part of its Western partners. Neutrality is increasingly perceived as a political and economic opportunism: on the one hand because Switzerland has banned Western countries from reexporting the Swiss war material in Ukraine, on the other because too many Russian goods have continued to circulate freely in the Swiss financial centre.\nThe G7 has repeatedly invited Switzerland to participate in its REPO task force (Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs), which aims to track and seize hidden Russian assets. So far, the Federal Council has not seen the need.\nThe data will vary. The Swiss Bankers Association estimated it in a figure of CHF 150 to CHF 200 billion. So far, Switzerland has frozen 7.5 billion, compared to 21.5 billion blocked by the European Union.\nNot all property belonging to Russian citizens or towns in Switzerland is subject to sanctions. The protection of private property is a key value in Switzerland; the confiscations are rare and the criminal context must first be demonstrated.\nIn the past, this has repeatedly provoked tensions, especially with the United States, often in relation to the sanctions taken in the name of the \"war on terrorism\".\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe bizarre case of Youssef Nada and the role of Switzerland in the \"war on terrorism\". A retrospective.\nIn the letter, the ambassadors of the G7 express the \"preoccupation\" for the fact that the Swiss provisions on data protection, originally intended to protect those who resort to justice, are used to hide the traces of parked goods (\"financial shelter\"). They also fear that the protection of the private sphere prevent judicial authorities from investigating the illegal financial structures created and managed by lawyers, lawyers and specialized consultants.\nIn 2016, with the Panama Papers case, public opinion was able to make an idea of the importance of legal and notary studies in the creation of offshore structures. These are not in itself illegal, but are often used for money laundering, tax evasion or other global illegal activities, as these revelations have clearly shown. Swiss law firms were also involved in the scandal.\nIn 2019, the Federal Council proposed a review of the law on money laundering to introduce diligence and review obligations for lawyers, lawyers, notaries and notaries, as long requested by the International Financial Action Group (GAFI), an intergovernmental organization that fights against money laundering and terrorist financing.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland must change its mindset about transparency, says Tom Keatinge.\nIn Parliament, however, the proposal has clashed against a strong opposition and in the end a version of the text has been adopted much less incisive, which has strengthened only a small part of the legislation on this subject. It's not even a case here. Many people sitting in Parliament are their own lawyers or lawyers and many have strongly opposed the proposed amendments.\nThe finance minister of the time, Ueli Maurer, warned Parliament: \"If you exclude consultants, as the majority wants, we will return to office, I can assure you.\"\nThe result is that now the Federal Council is drawing up a new bill to broaden the law on money laundering as originally planned. Will this time be more successful in Parliament? You will know that during this year.\nThe Confederation has always been considered a crossroads of doubtful financial flows. An image that continues to tell the banks, although most of them are trying to work cleanerly, and this is not only when the banking secrecy has been abolished.\nAlthough the clich\u00e9s are hard to die, according to the GAFI, Switzerland is quite well involved in the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism: of the 40 recommendations of the institution, it meets completely or largely 35 and partially 5. The United States, for their part, does not satisfy at all 4.\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to receive our articles.\nDelaware, the State of origin of President Joe Biden, is considered a refuge in which to conceal funds and a stronghold of the companies of convenience. Here, as in other American states, it is relatively easy to bypass the Fatca rules (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) and the automatic exchange of information.\nSo when part of Swiss politics defines foreign pressure as unjust and motivated by political considerations, it is not necessarily wrong. The Panama Papers have shown this: There are global networks that serve to hide and transfer financial assets - and there are accomplices everywhere, in one form or another.\nSeveral factors explain why Swiss lawyers and lawyers are now under pressure. For years, the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism has been increasingly coordinated internationally, but Switzerland has done so far only the essential minimum. After the Russian invasion, the country suddenly found itself at the center of attention.\nThe Swiss authorities want to start a\nto discover more quickly cases of money laundering and financing of terrorism. It will be mainly an exchange of information between the public and private sectors which should allow for greater prevention.\nAs the Federal Council writes, 20 of the 30 most important financial centres in the world already have such a partnership. The initiative is mainly concerned with the banking sector, which seems to have welcomed the proposal.\nHowever, this would not solve the problem. There are other yards open. For example, the Swiss real estate market is subject to fraud due to lack of regulation. Especially since in Switzerland the prices of properties are high, it is relatively easy to use this market to recycle large sums of money.\nAlso in this case, transactions happen through banks and legal service providers. As long as intermediaries \u2013 lawyers, lawyers, notaries and notaries \u2013 will continue to have a wide and protected margin of manoeuvre, foreign criticism will not decrease.\nOther developments\n\nSwitzerland carries out a dangerous game of balancing with the EU from which it could be defeated.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

In Vilnius, enlargement in northern Europe and the expansion of relations in the Indo-Pacific were agreed, and Ukraine was promised a process of accession.\nThe Confederation, an official NATO partner since 1997, was not present in Vilnius. \"Switzerland has not been invited as a participant or as an observer country,\" says the Federal Department of Defense, Protection of Population and Sports (DDPS).\nNevertheless, Switzerland is interested in greater presence and involvement in the Alliance. \"The accession of the free Nordic States to NATO command structures,\" he said.\n, head of DDPS security policy, contacted by SWI swissinfo.ch before the summit. \"Switzerland is also evaluating the possibility of sending staff to NATO's centres of excellence, such as the Center of Excellence for Military Engineering.\"\nThis centre, based in Ingolstadt, Germany, supports NATO and its partner states in developing the military strategy.\nIn fact, according to Pulli, the accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO creates not only new opportunities, but also challenges for Switzerland: \"The group of European NATO partner states has become smaller and now has less weight towards the Alliance.\"\nSwitzerland is therefore considering the possibility of \"participating in the entire range of exercises, including collective defence under Article 5 of the NATO Treaty\". According to this article, an attack against an allied state is considered an attack against all the countries of the Alliance.\nThe reason is to be found in recent geopolitical developments, underlines the high official: \"If Switzerland should be attacked, legal neutrality obligations would no longer apply and we should therefore have the opportunity to defend ourselves with our partner states, most of which are NATO members.\"\nThe strengthening of international cooperation should also serve this purpose. After Russia's attack on Ukraine, such a situation seems more plausible today, says Pulli.\nAny approach to NATO, however, points out, can only happen \"in compliance with neutrality and the interests of the partner States\". This obviously raises a question: what kind of neutrality is this about?\n\"There is no fixed code of conduct established for neutral states. We can define the application of neutrality largely independently,\" says Pulli. But it is also clear that \"the direct supply of weapons to a country in war as Ukraine is excluded from the legal profile, as well as the obligation of common defence\".\nIn Vilnius, it seems clear how urgent the issues of collective security have become. Nestled between the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad to the west and Belarus to the south, Lithuania has many similarities with the Cold War Berlin: only 30 kilometers from the capital, a border protected by high fences separates the European zone (democratic) from the Russian one (authoritarian).\nOther developments\nDebate\nNeutrality is on the test bench of world history. Do you have a future? And how should it be defined?\nDuring an inspection at the border of Medininkai, SWI swissinfo.ch met many people who fled from Iraq and Syria from Belarus on a bike. They don't want to answer questions or take pictures. According to Finnish security expert Rasmus Hindren, they are part of \"a hybrid war, as we have observed for years at the various external borders of the European Union\".\nWhile Lithuania (65,000 square kilometers and 2.8 million inhabitants) used the summit days to relate the war of Russia in Ukraine and its security interests, at the Vilnius meeting there was no trace of Switzerland and its concerns in this regard.\nOther developments\n\nA milestone in vacilla democracy.

This year, the number of Russian companies enrolled at an annual grain conference in Iran has risen sharply, said Nezam-Mafi.\nIran is also subjected to international sanctions since 1979. The last series of sanctions was set in 2006, after the country refused to end its uranium enrichment program.\nTrade in agricultural products is free from international sanctions for humanitarian reasons (see box). In Geneva, who is active in this sector confirms that the main agricultural traders and inspection companies have licenses that allow them to facilitate the trade of grain between Russia and Iran and maintain a presence in Tehran.\nIn 2021, Iran's national grain production was\n, which forced the country to resort to imports to compensate for lack. Iran has become the\nin\n, when Russian exports\ndue to the uncertainty of banks and shipping companies on how to react to international sanctions.\nIn July 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department extended the general licences on agricultural transactions, reasserting that cereals are not subject to the regime of sanctions against Russia. In a statement on food safety, the United States aims to bring essential goods such as wheat to \"reduce the impact of Russia's un provoked war against Ukraine on global food supplies and prices\". A previous communication, published in April 2022, at a time when the prices of wheat were at the stars, specified that the United States did not intend to hinder agricultural exports.\nIn August 2022 Switzerland adopted new rules to allow transactions with Russian companies, when they are considered necessary for humanitarian trade. The Federal Council also introduced the possibility of defrosting the assets of sanctioned entities if considered essential for grain transactions.\nThe supplies are partly resumed because Moscow wanted to diversify its export markets. But Iran remained among the top three destinations, absorbing 15% of overseas grain sales in 2021 and 13% in 2022, according to Kpler data, a company that analyzes the evolution of commodity markets.\nIn previous periods of shortage on the internal market, Iran imported grain from\n, including Germany. But in the last two years the dependence on Russia has increased: in 2021, 83% of the imports of wheat arrived from that country, 72% in 2022, according to the data compiled by Kpler.\nThe \"five big\" cereal traders are reluctant to openly discuss the subject. When SWI swissinfo.ch asked ADM for a comment on his activities, a spokesman was limited to saying that the company \"works globally, linking crops and markets to more than 190 countries and respecting all imposed regulations and sanctions\".\nIn his financial statement of 2022, Louis Dreyfus declared that he had suspended operations in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, but had resumed them \"as far as possible, with the aim of satisfying the commitments and demand of customers, in compliance with all sanctions, laws and regulations\". In April,\nreported that the company planned to discontinue Russian grain exports from July 2023, but a spokesman contacted by SWI swissinfo.ch refused to comment or provide further details about Iran.\nBunge, Cargill and Cosco did not respond to our repeated urges to know if sanctions for humanitarian reasons allowed them to facilitate the trade in grain between Russia and Iran.\nEven with humanitarian licenses, cereal trade with Iran is difficult. \"Most people have no idea how difficult it is to do business in one of the most sanctioned countries in the world,\" said SWI swissinfo.ch.\n, member of the Governing Council of the Middle East and Africa region of the International Mugnai Association, during the Geneva Conference.\nOne of the key issues is payment, because the financial sanctions in force for a long time have prevented Iran from accessing the international banking system. \"There are two problems when it comes to banking with Iran,\" he says.\n, economist and founder of the Bourse & Bazaar Foundation, a think tank based in London that deals with Middle East and Central Asia.\n\"Most people have no idea how difficult it is to do business in one of the most sanctioned countries in the world. \"\n, International Association of Mugnai\n\"First of all, very few Iranian banks have banking correspondence with European institutions or any other bank,\" he explains. Most international banks are reluctant to maintain relations with countries subjected to sanctions, even for humanitarian goods. The importing companies of Iranian wheat struggle to find a bank channel to make payments to those who export, says Batmanghelidj.\nSecondly, access to strong currencies is limited. \"The problem is that the Iranian Central Bank (CBI) has undergone the freezing of most of its foreign reserves and oil money that Iran used to finance its trade is no longer easily accessible,\" explains Batmanghelidj. The United States has\nin humanitarian trade to fight against money laundering and terrorist financing.\nThe CBI is also at the centre of a\nfor essential goods such as grain, which offers traders a preferential exchange rate that allows them to import at lower costs. But the central bank failed to meet strong currency demand in a timely manner. The result is that the ships carrying the grain remained\noutside the Iranian ports for months, waiting for payment of their cargos (see map).\nIn recent years\nthey rose to the stars in Iran because of the collapse of the national currency and the cut of subsidies from the government. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) calculated that the number of Iranians and Iranians who cannot afford healthy food rose to 17,1 million in 2020 - more than 20% of the population - compared to 9,6 million in 2017.\n\"Iran is not a country where there is a serious food crisis, but sanctions have created a context in which the accessibility and availability of essential goods, including foodstuffs, are not guaranteed,\" says Batmanghelidj.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe commodity trade is essential, but controversial. That\u2019s how Switzerland has become a global player of industry weight.\nWheat is not the only manifestation of the increasing links between Russia and Iran. Moscow showed\nfor the development of new commercial routes. Diplomacy is in ferment, with several presidential meetings only in 2022. Just a month after the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Minister committed to working with Iran to circumvent international sanctions. The rapprochement has alarmed the United States, whose absolute priority is to stop the supply of weapons between the two countries.\nOne of the main projects is the North-South International Transport Corridor (INSTC), which aims to connect Russia to India through Central Asia and Iran. The network of railways, highways and maritime routes through and around the Caspian Sea should be more direct than the winding path through the seas of the North and the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal,\nof the transport of goods.\nAlthough the project has been under discussion for over 20 years, Western sanctions have reinvigorated Russia's interest. A proof batch of goods was shipped from St. Petersburg through the Caspian Sea in Mumbai in June 2022. Meanwhile, Iran is\nto the Eurasian Economic Union, a free trade bloc composed of several former Soviet states.\nMoscow and Tehran would have worked to establish\nto circumvent the international system dominated by the West and Russia became the largest investor in Iran. The two-thirds of foreign direct investment in the country between January and March 2023, amounting to $2.76 billion, came from Russia, according to the Iranian Ministry of Finance.\nHowever, this Russian-Iranian friendship has limits. INSTC railway lines are incomplete and, although maritime routes are operational, the loading capacity on the Caspian Sea is limited.\nEconomist Esfandyar Batmanghelidj doubts that the intensification of relations with Russia can change the charts at the table for Iran. \"There are still banking restrictions,\" he says. \"It will be very difficult for Russia and Iran to create a supply chain that complies with the impossibility of buying essential goods on the global market.\"\nOther developments\n\nLike many other developed countries, Switzerland is confronted with an important shortage of personnel in many sectors.\nYet, corporate leaders who attended the grain conference in Geneva have seen many opportunities to increase regional trade. From the Iranian point of view, the bite of markets and Western approaches is loosening.\nArticles mentioned\nSeries Switzerland and sanctions against Russia\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

                "en_content": "Will Switzerland enter NATO? This scenario still seems far away. However, for a year we have been discussing a closer collaboration with the military alliance, an approach supported by almost all political groups. The question of the moment is: how far should Switzerland go?\nThe Confederation is not the only neutral country in Europe to question. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has permanently overwhelmed European security architecture and NATO's defensive alliance, after years of disorientation, is tightening the ranks. Neutral and unified states in Europe are looking for their position in the conflict - and most are approaching NATO in one way or another.\nThe most radical step is that of the two Nordic States,\nand\n, who decided to enter NATO.\nIn 2023, Finland was the 31st State to join NATO. Since he became a member of the European Union in 1995, he no longer defines himself as neutral, but a country not aligned. This statute has always been seen more as a necessary concession in the face of a near bully, Russia, than as a decision of an ethical nature.\nIt was a realpolitik decision to maintain its sovereignty towards the Soviet Union. This so-called \"Finlandization\" was progressively abandoned after the end of the Cold War.\nSweden also decided to join NATO, just over two months after the Russian invasion of Ukraine - a break with the traditional neutrality that the Scandinavian country had cultivated for two centuries. But the path to NATO was not so direct: Turkey and Hungary had advanced requests and blocked the accession process in an attempt to acquire a certain political influence. Last week, during the NATO summit in Vilnius, Turkey secured its support and Sweden should become the 32nd Alliance country in the coming months.\nFor NATO, the accession of the two Nordic States is not only important from the symbolic point of view, but also from the military one: Finland has a highly equipped army and shares a frontier of 1'340 kilometers with Russia, while Sweden has a strong war industry.\nIn 1994,\nentered the \"permanent neutrality\" clause in its Constitution. This is partly due to internal policy reasons: The multiethnic state, of which Transnistria was also a member, sought to achieve a social balance through a non-alignment policy which would be accepted by the whole population.\nAccording to the polls, the majority of the population still supports this neutrality. The first controversial discussions took place after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and intensified after the Russian invasion of all Ukraine in 2022. The focus is on EU membership and the country does not explicitly want to enter NATO.\nIn 2007,\nA militarily neutral state was declared, also recognized by NATO, against which that decision was directed. Like Moldova, Serbia did not adopt sanctions against Russia and politically maneuver between the West and the East - in the tradition of the Movement of Unified Countries, which was the state doctrine of the former Yugoslavia.\nThe small state of\nentered neutrality in its Constitution in 1987. This is a late consequence of decolonization: the former British colony was considered part of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, which distanced itself from the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Today neutrality is undisputed and Malta is the only EU member country not to participate in the permanent structured cooperation PESCO, the joint European defence project.\nEven the\nIt was a British colony and its neutrality was proclaimed by the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which sanctioned Irish independence. Unlike other neutral countries in Europe, Ireland has minimal defensive capabilities and interprets its \"military neutrality\" in a less rigid way.\nHowever, this aspect has become controversial lately: the cyber attacks on the health system by Russian hackers in 2021 (in the middle of the pandemic) relativized the geographical isolation of the country. Moreover, along its Atlantic coast pass submarine cables essential for global communications. Ireland has therefore launched a public consultation to discuss the future of its neutrality: an approach to NATO is certainly considered an option.\nThe situation is different for\n, whose neutrality is not internationally recognized. The country traditionally has close ties with Russia: the Soviet Union was considered an important military partner since the invasion of Turkey, a NATO state in 1974. However, membership of NATO is impossible because the territorial conflict remains unresolved and Turkey - which does not recognize the country - would immediately veto.\nCritical voices within the country say that\nis \"a NATO exploiter\" - the same charge is felt in Switzerland. There is also another important point in common: neutrality as an identity element. Unlike Switzerland, however, Austrian neutrality is anchored in the Constitution. This is the result of negotiations on the withdrawal of employment forces after World War II: the Soviets demanded the \"perpetual neutrality\" of the country, while the Allies accepted any armed neutrality on the Swiss model.\nThe complete abandonment of neutrality and accession to NATO find little support in Austria. But the country, like Switzerland, participates in the Partnership for Peace (PfP) and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership (EAPC). These allow cooperation with NATO and each participating nation can independently determine the scope of this cooperation. Together with Switzerland, Austria now wants to participate in the European Sky Shield air defense system. That would be the only two non-NATO states to be part of this initiative.\nIn\n, it is not only neutrality to be perennial, but also the discussion around it. From the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine, we are discussing how Switzerland should place itself in the war. The Confederacy has adopted sanctions against Russia, sends humanitarian aid to Ukraine and generally supports the West. However, financial aid to Ukraine is relatively small, as in the case of other neutral states. Above all, NATO member states provide money and military support.\nThe fact that Switzerland has banned European countries from bringing back its war material has provoked discontent. According to the most frequent criticisms, the Confederation hides behind its neutrality and continues to profit from economic interweavings, without taking sufficiently incisive measures against the Russian oligarchy.\nThe accusation of opportunism, however, is not new and is not limited to Switzerland. The neutral states with a clearly Western orientation have benefited from the NATO shield, without having to do anything in return.\nThe Federal Defence Department argues that the capacity for cooperation of the Swiss armed forces - known as interoperability - should be greatly strengthened. In security environments, the Russian attack on Ukraine made a military connection with NATO more urgent.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland wants more cooperation with NATO, but this would lead to the Treaty for the prohibition of nuclear weapons.\nAs the air defence system demonstrates, the defence policy of the continent is consolidating: the EU, NATO and neutral countries cooperate more closely at different levels. To silence those who are skeptical, it is underlined that in these constellations there is no need for assistance.\nFrom the Russian point of view, however, it is a secondary question: Moscow no longer considers Switzerland a neutral country because of sanctions and ranked it as a \" hostile State\".\nOther developments\n\nSwitzerland carries out a dangerous game of balancing with the EU from which it could be defeated.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

With the scene exit of Prigozhin, it could be the end of Wagner's activities in those countries,\" he says.\n\"I think the situation could be different in Africa, where Wagner really operated as a commercial actor. There is demand for Wagner's services and local elites are willing to pay by public money or by other means. I don't see another security provider that can take over, at least in the short term, and offer the same kind of services to countries, especially in Africa,\" says Rousseau.\nWagner is known for his significant presence in fragile states such as the Central African Republic, where he was accused of looting mineral resources and abuse against the civilian population. It is also present in Mali and Burkina Faso, a theatre in the recent past of military strikes. Following the 26 July coup in Niger, some protesters openly called for Wagner's arrival in the country. This is seen as part of the growing anti-Western feeling in some parts of Africa, that Russia is eager to exploit.\nIn fact, Prigozhin, in a video broadcast on social media just before his death, appeared on a desert background, meaning he was in Africa. He talked about making Russia bigger on all continents and Africa more \"free\".\n\"I think that, especially in fragile countries, where we see groups like Wagner working, there is no capacity to regulate them, monitor them and believe them responsible,\" says Rousseau. \"The discussion on Prigozhin and Wagner should act as a catalyst. Wagner exploited the gaps of the system to carry out his activities and, if we want to avoid a new Wagner group, these gaps must be filled\".\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nIn the 19th century, young Swiss of modest origins played part in the dirty work of foreign colonial forces in Asia and Africa.\nRousseau explains that Switzerland is among the main countries for the development of better regulation.

                "en_content": "Toomas Hendrick Ilves says he can't understand the logic behind the refusal of the Swiss government to revoke the ban on exporting Swiss weapons sold to third countries. \"It's like selling an anti-tank weapon to use as decoration,\" he says.\nIlves is a Estonian politician and diplomat. He was President of Estonia (2006-2016) and Member of the European Parliament. Parents fled to the United States after the invasion and occupation of the Baltic States by the Soviet Union in 1940.\n: I found it very strange when the Swiss President [Alain Berset] said: \"We cannot export weapons that will be used at war.\" So why manufacture weapons? I mean, do you produce museum pieces? What's the point? If so, close your weapons industry. [The Swiss] have become ridiculous.\nNuclear weapons become old, as well as their technology.\nFirst, let us admit it, it is very easy to be neutral when it is surrounded by NATO. Secondly, I do not think that the Swiss Government is attracted by many sympathy from the countries that have been invaded, like mine. Estonia was a neutral country and in 1939-1940 it was first invaded by the Russians, then by the Nazis and then by the Russians. Neutrality is a good thing to have if you are around NATO, but it does not work.\nHe practically managed to destroy the last vestiges of democracy in Russia and eliminated all forms of opposition, resorting to detention or murder. This is the impact. We're dealing with an almost totalitarian dictatorship.\nWell, of course, at least as far as technology is concerned. Why do Russian soldiers in Ukraine have to import huge amounts of refrigerators and washing machines? It's because they can't get the chips to put in the teleguided missiles. So, in this sense, yes, technological sanctions seem to have effect. And it also seems that Russia is working happily to bypass the sanctions on oil. The sanctions need time to have effect.\nOther developments\n\nSwitzerland carries out a dangerous game of balancing with the EU from which it could be defeated.\nIn the meantime, however, there is the broken-sanction action of Turkey, Kazakhstan and Armenia. This is always a problem. There may be agreements between the European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea and so on, but countries like Armenia, Turkey and Kazakhstan always try to profit.\nThe only things Putin respects are strength and power. What we have to do is stop holding. It has come a long way since last February when Germany supplied 5'000 helmets to Ukraine. But it is quite clear that without serious military support, Ukraine cannot win.\nKiev would be almost completely destroyed today, if Ukraine had not had the Patriot missiles to break down the missiles directed towards the city. There is a need for strong support from the West. Even here, again, the West played the self-dissuasion card. Putin threatens to use atomic weapons and everyone says: \"Oh no, we can't let Ukrainians have more material.\" Then the West slowly realizes that if you provide anti-tank missiles and anti-missile material does not break the Third World War.\nAnd even more importantly, what the West does not understand enough is that, if you do not help Ukraine, you can throw in the garbage the last 80 years of international law, because Putin is practically saying to the civilized world: \"I can invade and there are no consequences.\"\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to receive our articles.\nI don't think that makes sense a de-escalation right now. Because this means allowing Russia to control and strengthen the defence of the territory that it has occupied illegally. I would say that now it takes the opposite \u2013 a very strong push to free the occupied areas of Ukraine, especially since we know that when Russia occupies a territory commits the most horrible war crimes.\nSo when I hear people say, \"We must have a de-escalation and a ceasefire,\" he says, in practice: \"Go ahead, Russia. Kill, rape, torture.\" So \"de-escalation\" is a word you can say while you are a bathtub sipping a glass of ros\u00e9 wine. But we're talking about torture victims and rapes.\nWhat I see in Europe is a division between countries that have experienced the Soviet occupation and countries that have done so. In Estonia, everyone has a relative, a grandfather, a grandmother, someone who suffered under the Soviet yoke. People call the Estonian minister [Kaja Kallas] a \"falco\". His mother had six months of life when [in 1940] she was deported to a cattle car in Siberia, where she remained until seven years, then returning to Estonia. The assumption of people who have never passed from this kind of experience and tells us that we do not know how to deal with Russia is hateful. It's revolting.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nBeijing wants to promote its vision of human rights. A battle that takes place in the halls of the Palace of Nations in Geneva.\nWell, I'm talking about the inability, especially Western and European politicians, to understand what's going on and not to give the right weight to the experiences that people in the East have experienced. This has bothered me since she read a review\nof\nby Alexander Solzhenitsyn. The reviewer said: \"Solzhenitsyn doesn't know what he's talking about.\" This is the peculiar inability of people to understand what happened. Western politicians could preach to us for years about how they know how to get along with the Russians when they have no experience with the Russians.\nWe're at war. We all make sacrifices at war. We pay higher energy costs because we do not use Russian gas and oil. There's an impact on everyone. The short-term problems of people simply do not matter when it comes to crimes against humanity committed right now in Ukraine.\nThese exceptions already exist. It's not a problem. As you know, there are no restrictions on humanitarian assistance. And they have always existed, even in the case of sanctions against Iran.\nI think Ukrainian people shouldn't be affected by Russian war crimes. I don't care who can be disturbed by sanctions when there are ongoing war crimes in Ukraine. And I don't even see these people protest. If that's the case, protest! Maybe they'll change my mind.\nYeah, people in prison. Ma\nseems that support for war has grown in Russia. Dimitri Peskov's daughter is still an intern in the European Parliament. And I'm\n,\nyou give to the crazy shopping in Paris, it is left to enter and spend thousands of euros. These things shouldn't happen.\nI really don't know anything about the business that Swiss banks do with Russia. But I know that the Raiffeisen International Bank [Austrian banking institute, ndr] is granting loans to Russian soldiers. For my part, I would sanction all the banks that help Russia.\n\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

Now, she ran for another warrant.\nOnly the 47 members of the Council have the right to vote, which means that they are the only ones who decide, for example, what countries will be scrutiny and criticised for the way they defend or violate human rights.\nMarc Limon, Director of Universal Rights Group, headquartered in Geneva, says that electing Russia as a member would be \"actually completely wrong\". \"If the General Assembly suspends a country for serious and systematic violations of human rights and then re-elected it while violations continue and there was no responsibility, it would be a disaster for the credibility of the Council for Human Rights and for that of the United Nations in general,\" says SWI swissinfo.ch.\nThe Council elections are held in regional groups. The central and eastern European group has three candidates for two seats: Albania, Bulgaria and Russia. Limon explains that Russia has been campaigning for a long time and Albania has just applied \u2013 probably under the pressure of Western states.\nHuman rights organizations also oppose China's candidacy, which is currently a member of the Council and intends to obtain a second mandate. Organizations recall the UN report published a year ago, which made possible crimes against humanity against the Uyghur community in the province of Xinjiang and Beijing's poor human rights behaviour in Tibet and Hong Kong.\nResolution 6251 of the UN General Assembly, which created the Human Rights Council in 2006, states that \"the members elected to the Council must respect the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights\" and \" fully cooperate with the Council\". This is not the case of Russia or China.\nUnlike Russia, China has no competition in its regional group, where there are four candidates for four seats. It seems therefore that it will be re-elected, but according to Salma El Hosseiny, of ISHR, states can still resist. \"States are not obliged to vote for all candidates, even in a case like this,\" says SWI swissinfo.ch. \"Do not vote for candidates who do not meet the requirements, a strong message is sent, even if they were eventually elected.\"\nThe ISHR also calls for an end to closed lists. \"It's a problem,\" says Hosseiny, \"one of our main appeals is that regional groups should submit a greater number of applications than the available seats, so that elections are competitive.\"\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nBeijing wants to promote its vision of human rights. A battle that takes place in the halls of the Palace of Nations in Geneva.\nA UN Committee of Inquiry on Ukraine, created by mandate of the Human Rights Council, stated in March that Russia committed \"a multitude\" of war crimes in Ukraine and allegedly also crimes against humanity. In an update report to the Council, presented\nIt also stated that the commission is affecting the charges of genocide committed in Ukraine. \"Part of rhetoric used by state media and not in Russia, could be incite to genocide,\" we read.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian presidential commissioner for the rights of children, Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, were charged by the International Criminal Tribunal for the crime of forced deportation of children.\nThe UN Special Envoy for Human Rights in Russia, Mariana Katzarov, in September spoke of a repression of a \"unprevious\" flow from the times of Stalin.\nGiven all this, Russian candidacy might seem like \"a joke\", as the human rights defender Hassan Shine writes in a published lane\n. \"And a joke of even more bad taste would be to see elected Russia,\" he adds. However, that this happens is not impossible.\nLimon says that states should, in theory, vote according to the criteria already mentioned, but in reality it is rather a bargaining that takes place within various international organizations in favour of an application. Russia has prepared the road in this sense and Limon thinks that Moscow is no longer completely isolated as it was last year, when all attention was focused on the newly invaded Ukraine.\nThe expert thinks that the seat is now what made for Bulgaria and that between Albania and Russia the margin is minimal. \"I'm very, very concerned,\" says SWI swissinfo.ch. If Russia is elected, Limon thinks, this could put into question the very future of the Human Rights Council. The Director of Universal Rights Group recalls that the main reason for the collapse of the Commission on human rights, which preceded the Council, was precisely the presence in it of countries which seriously violated human rights.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Rights Council is the UN body for the promotion and defence of human rights.\nOther developments\n\nSwitzerland carries out a dangerous game of balancing with the EU from which it could be defeated.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

Although Hamas has been designated as such by several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and the European Union (EU), the previous attempts of some members of the Swiss Parliament in this sense have all failed.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe Federal Council has commissioned the Middle East task force to assess legal options to ban the Palestinian organization.\n\"On the basis of the law in force in Switzerland, this step can only be accomplished if the United Nations Security Council designates Hamas as a terrorist organization, which has not done. Therefore, the Confederation must create a special legislation which must be approved by Parliament,\" said Marco Sassoli, professor of international law at the University of Geneva.\nEven in this case it is unlikely that it is a permanent ban. Despite Al-Qaeda and the so-called Islamic State have been designated as terrorist groups by the United Nations, the Swiss authorities establish only temporary bans for them that must be renewed every five years, as the Law on Information Activities lays down.\nSuch a ban could then make certain activities promoted by the Confederation difficult. Switzerland contributes CHF 20 million a year to the ordinary budget of the United Nations Agency for the relief and occupation of Palestinian refugees in the Middle East (UNRWA) and finances approximately 30 NGOs in the Palestinian territory (5 million francs in 2022). According to Sassoli, it would be almost impossible to ensure that all these organizations have nothing to do with Hamas.\n\"We condemn Hamas' attack, but this organization continues to manage the Gaza Strip. If you want to deliver food, medicine or help children, you need to talk to Hamas. You can't get by helicopter!\", says Sassoli.\nThe EU still manages to send aid to Palestine despite having entered Hamas in the list of terrorist groups already in 2003, a decision that has been successfully contested several times in court. However, the recent attack prompted European assistance to be reviewed urgently.\n\"Our humanitarian support to the Palestinian people is not in question. However, it is important to carefully review our financial assistance. EU funding has never gone and will never go to Hamas or any terrorist entity. We shall now review the entire portfolio in the light of developments in the field,\" said Mr Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission on Wednesday.\nSwitzerland, however, is in a better position than the EU to draw up Hamas on the list of terrorist organizations and continue to provide essential aid to the Palestinian population.\n\"If Switzerland approves special legislation designating Hamas as a terrorist group, it should provide an exception clause to offer neutral humanitarian service to the population. An exception of this type is already present in the Swiss Criminal Code, which prohibits activities considered to support terrorism,\" says Sassoli.\nIt refers to Article 260 of the Swiss Criminal Code dealing with penises for support of \"criminal or terrorist organizations\". The article provides an exception, since \"it does not apply to humanitarian services provided by an impartial humanitarian organization, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, in accordance with Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949\".\nThe most thorny question will be to get the money to the people in need in Palestine through the federal financial system.\n\"Even with an exception to humanitarian assistance, you will have an indirect freezing effect. No bank will transfer money to a place run by a group placed in a terrorist list,\" says Sassoli.\nReputation and integrity are key factors for the Swiss financial centre, says Robert Reinecke, spokesman of the Swiss Bankers Association.\n\"Anti-recycling measures have been constantly expanded and strengthened in recent years. Banks are subject to complete obligations of\nand\nto prevent money laundering and financial crime,\" he says.\nCatalonia Hamas as a terrorist organization could also compromise Switzerland's ability to act as a mediator in the Middle East. The neutrality of the Confederation has made it a trusted partner in the region: Switzerland is currently the diplomatic interests of Iran in Egypt and Canada, the United States in Iran and Iran in Saudi Arabia (and vice versa).\nIn 2021, responding to a parliamentary question, the Helvetic Government indicated that relations with Israel and Hamas also rest on good grounds.\nAccording to Sassoli, Switzerland's diplomatic burden in the region would be affected if Hamas was included in the list of terrorist organizations.\n\"There are negotiations with the United States on Israeli hostages involving Turkey and Qatar. It will be difficult for Switzerland to play a role in these negotiations if Hamas is considered a terrorist organization,\" the professor of international law concludes.\nOther developments\n\nSwitzerland carries out a dangerous game of balancing with the EU from which it could be defeated.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

                "en_title": "\"Declaring Hamas a terrorist organization is in contradiction with Switzerland's neutrality\"",
                "en_content": ":\nUntil recent developments, the dialogue with Hamas, despite the world\u2019s opinion on this organization, has enabled Switzerland to mediate effectively during past conflicts and negotiations, and this is precisely thanks to its neutrality. To declare Hamas a terrorist organization is in contradiction with the historical neutrality of the country and its role as mediator.\nBy doing so, Switzerland would risk influencing its ability to act and perform mediation work in regional conflicts and future negotiations, such as for the release of hostages or to facilitate dialogue between the parties.\nSwitzerland should leverage its tradition of neutrality and mediation without deploying with Israel or Palestine. It is possible to recognize that both parties may have committed war crimes, as demonstrated by Hamas' actions and Israel's response. Switzerland can provide a valuable service and warn against a potential depletion of hostilities, such as an invasion by Israel in Gaza, underlining the risk of war crimes multiplying. In order to do this, however, the Swiss Minister of Foreign Affairs must have the necessary strength and determination, and this aspect of concern given the current apparent weakness.\nSure. Following the 1993 Oslo Agreements (including Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization), Switzerland set up a group of diplomats and diplomats who worked effectively. Today that political will is a distant memory: the Swiss diplomatic corps is in smaller numbers and is not equally prepared. For Swiss diplomacy in the region this is a problem not recently.\nThe population of Gaza exceeds two million inhabitants, most of whom are refugees who benefit from UNRWA\u2019s help (the United Nations Agency for the Rescue and Employment of Palestinian Refugees in the Near East), partly funded by Switzerland. The UNRWA, the only United Nations agency providing humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees and refugees, unlike UNHCR, which deals with legal protection.\nOther developments\n\nSwitzerland carries out a dangerous game of balancing with the EU from which it could be defeated.\nIt should not be forgotten that the more than six million Palestinian refugees and refugees in the region have no legal protection and are therefore particularly vulnerable worldwide.\nUNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) and UNRWA (United Nations Agency for Relief and Employment of Palestinian Refugees in the Near East) both deal with refugee issues, but have separate mandates and operational areas, especially with regard to the Palestinian people:\n\u2022 UNHCR: established in 1950, its main purpose is to protect and support refugee people worldwide. It offers assistance to those who are refugee, apolides and, in some cases, to internally displaced persons, regardless of their nationality or origin.\n\u2022 UNRWA: Founded in 1949, it has the exclusive mandate to provide assistance, protection and patronage specifically to Palestinian refugee people who have lost their homes and means of subsistence due to the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict.\n\u2022 UNHCR: operates globally in various countries affected by displacement.\n\u2022 UNRWA: Works specifically in five areas: West Bank, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.\n\u2022 UNHCR: a refugee is a person forced to flee his country due to persecution, war or violence. The 1951 Refugee Convention is the main definition used by UNHCR.\n\u2022 UNRWA: Uses a more specific definition. A Palestinian refugee is a person \"whose place of habitual residence was Palestine in the period between 1 June 1946 and 15 May 1948, and who lost both the house and the means of sustenance because of the 1948 conflict\".\n\u2022 UNHCR: provides legal protection, asylum application procedures, fields, emergency interventions and resettlement services.\n\u2022 UNRWA: It offers a wide range of services, including education, healthcare, social services, infrastructure and fields improvement, microfinance and emergency interventions.\nBy cutting humanitarian aid, Switzerland would commit a diplomatic suicide. What base would it stop the provision of humanitarian aid? It is not possible to prove that Hamas takes the money for aid. The allocation of international assistance in Gaza has become a sophisticated mechanism, which guarantees in-depth checks regarding those who benefit from aid and how funds are spent.\nThe European Union, which provides important financial aid, uses a specific mechanism called\nIn order to ensure that the funds will end with the associations and institutions to which they were intended. Therefore, even if there may be episodes of financial maladministration, any charge should be suffragated by clear examples instead of spreading claims without foundation.\nNow, the solution of the two states seems to be invariable. The current Israeli logic provides a single state. In the legal context, Israel under the administration of the occupied territories has established laws that discriminate and separate Palestinian people and force them to leave their homes. The question of racial discrimination in Israel has become increasingly important since 2017, when\nwhich accuses Israel of imposing an apartheid regime against the Palestinian population.\n\n\n\n\nMicheline Calmy-Rey's opinion on Swiss neutrality against the war in Ukraine.\nThe failure of the solution of the two states, as demonstrated by the difficulties that have characterized the Geneva Initiative (launched in 2003 by the will of Israeli and Palestinian civil society), suggests that alternative solutions, such as a federalist model, should be considered. The opening to new models of building peace, such as the federalist one, largely depends on the willingness of the parties involved to overcome the usual political and territorial positions. The question is complex and multifaceted, and demands a certain commitment at international and local level.\nVarious Palestinian and Israeli organizations are examining alternative models. These include the \"solution with a single democratic State\", the one with a \"binational State\" and the one with a \"federation\". However, as an accomplice to the current conflict, it is currently difficult to deepen these options in detail and to propel for one of them. Before becoming more involved in this analysis it is essential to wait for the outcome of the war.\nThe difference should be sought in legal and constitutional architecture. Israel, which is defined as a Jewish democratic state without an organic constitution, moves between delicate religious and political balances. A \"Unified Democratic State\" would imply that all citizens enjoy the same status, regardless of whether they are Jewish or Palestinian, as well as a well-defined constitution that guarantees equal rights. On the contrary, a \"binational state\" could involve different political structures for the two national groups, but it should be conscientiously planned to avoid internal conflicts and ensure equal representation of rights for all and all. To explore these models it is necessary to consider carefully the different religious and political perspectives present in the region.\nA \"binational State\" would also imply that the right to self-determination is recognized both for people of Jewish origin and for those of Palestinian origin; look, this, which surprisingly has never been declared officially. In the 2018 State-nation bill, Israel stated that only Israelis and Israelis of Jewish origin are entitled to self-determination. However, this right was crucial during the process of decolonization of other regions such as Africa and India.\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to receive our articles.\nLooking at the efforts made in the past, such as those following the Oslo agreements, you can draw an important lesson on the need to apply and strictly respect international law in the processes of building peace. Despite the agreements, after 1994 Israel was able to confiscate territories with ever greater frequency without interventions or significant consequences from the international community. Europe and the United States have not been able to ensure that the factions involved strictly respected international law and norms. From all this we should learn that it is essential to consider the parties responsible for their actions. States must comply with legal and ethical standards; should not allow its geopolitical or diplomatic relations to soften the needs of legitimate and impartial practices in the context of the resolution of international conflicts.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

According to Reporter without frontiers, the country of the European Union is at 41st place in the world. But bad news doesn't end here: last year 25 journalists had to be protected by police 24/7. And there are new intimidations officially reported almost every day, as summarizes the ministry of the Interior of Rome.\nOne of these protected journalists is Paolo Berizzi, chronicler of the daily newspaper\nspecialized in reporting the activities of neo-fascist organizations in the country. For this reason he has been under police protection since 2019. Berizzi is a special case because he is the only journalist who requires an escort for political reasons: all others are threatened by mafias and organized crime.\nWith his inquiries, articles and books Paolo Berizzi has denounced for twenty years the return of neo-fascism and neo-nazism. \"In Italy there is a problem of fascism or better than fascism because there are different types. Fascisms in recent years have raised their heads because we have underestimated and normalized them and, in recent years, thanks to conditions favourable to their return, racist, discriminatory and nostalgic impulses have emerged that involve elected Members who have sworn on the Italian Constitution, European parliamentarians and representatives of the institutions who want to convince us that fascism is not only negative but has done good things,\" he concludes. Adding that if he could not go back. \"I'd do everything I did. For me journalism is either civil or it is not: or it serves to denounce phenomena that undermine cohabitation and our daily life, or abdicate to its main function. And I'd pay the price that this job has done and does.\"\nOther developments\n\nA milestone in vacilla democracy. Who protects freedom of expression?\n\"We are one of the few countries with so many journalists under escort and this is not normal. On the contrary, it is an indicator that journalists struggle to do their job. In a free country there should be no journalists under guard and the fact that there are so many forced to live under armed protection is a sign of defeat for the state that must protect those who are threatened,\" says Berizzi at SWI swissinfo.ch.\nBerizzi is our last \"global goal of freedom\".\nSeries Voices of Freedom from the World",

                "en_content": "\"We tried to estimate the correct numbers starting from the few information available,\" explained Tuesday at the press agency Keystone-ATS Niklas Stoehr of the Swiss Federal Polytechnic of Zurich (ETH), specialized in the statistical registration of things difficult to measure.\nIn collaboration with researchers from the University of North Carolina and the University of Chicago in the United States, Stoehr developed a model, based on the so-called Bayesian statistics, able to estimate losses during conflicts. The results were published in the last issue of the magazine\n.\n\"The countries or political actors involved in a conflict are encouraged to hide or manipulate these numbers, while third parties may not have access to reliable information,\" he is remembered in the study.\nApplied to the first year of the Russian aggression war in Ukraine, the model estimates that about 76,700 Russian military and about 17,200 Ukrainians were killed. For each Russian military killed Russian sources reported only 0.3 casualties, he notes the study. On the contrary, for every Ukrainian military killed, Russian sources reported 4.3 victims.\nAccording to statistics, Ukrainian sources have overestimated the deaths of the counterpart, reporting almost twice as many victims as the estimate of the new model. The authors did not find any evidence of systematic partiality in the Ukrainian reports on the deaths of Ukrainian soldiers.\nFor their model, researchers have used publicly accessible data. In total, 4'609 reports of civilian casualties and soldiers fell on social networks, news and various government sources. The figures of daily and cumulated victims were given in the various reports. \"Sometimes they don't even coincide in the same media,\" Stoehr explained, and \"there is even less correspondence between the different sources.\"\nThe model interpolates the figures of losses from different sources and, on the basis of various transparent hypotheses, calculates an average value. The researchers were inspired by the so-called \"\n\" - a well-known statistical problem developed by the Allies during World War II to estimate the number of German panzers.\nThe model can also be used in other scenarios where different parts have a natural interest in falsifying the figures and where the accumulated and absolute values are not necessarily consistent. For example, you could use it to study data on counters in a pandemic, the scientist explained.\nYou probably never know exactly how much the deaths of the conflict were in Ukraine, Stoehr said. However, these hopes that estimates will create greater transparency.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nMelissa Parke, the new ICAN executive director, talks about the challenges to overcome for a future without nuclear weapons.\nArticles mentioned",

In these areas, the scene of heavy fighting, accidents multiply: peasants unintentionally trigger anti-tank mines while working in the fields and civilians, including children, are disbanded by explosive devices or anti-personnel mines in their gardens or as they clear the rubble of their homes.\nThe demining therefore, according to the Swiss Government, is absolutely urgent and is a prerequisite for the reconstruction of the country, historically considered \"the granary of Europe\". In the light of these considerations, the Confederation decided to strengthen the current international cooperation programme, stressing humanitarian demining.\nCompared to the 1.8 billion already allocated to Ukraine by the Federal Council, the Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis specified, there would be 50 million more available, those that will pour the DDPS.\nSwitzerland has avant-garde expertise in this area: In Geneva, the International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD), which in the last decade has provided Ukraine with training, strategic support and technical advice to strengthen the capacity of government institutions.\nIn addition, a Swiss organization, the Fondation suisse de d\u00e9minage (FSD), is already present in Ukraine and in the Confederation there are several producers of demining machinery.\nIn the last two years the Confederation has already allocated 15.2 million francs for the demining in Ukraine, in particular in support of the activities of GICHD and the FSD.\nFor its part, the DDPS has given Ukrainian humanitarian organizations a demining device of the Digger Foundation, based in the Jura, and finances the formation of Ukrainian humanitarian experts from GICHD.\nWith the additional package of 100 million, he specified the head of the Federal Department of Defence, Protection of Population and Sports (DDPS) Viola Amherd, Switzerland will further expand the demining work carried out by these and other organizations, provide equipment and training to Ukrainian mills, support the government in coordinating this enterprise and explore innovative approaches.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe UN General Assembly will vote on the 15 new members of the Human Rights Council.

Switzerland does not have the means to define \"terrorist\" organizations, but this does not mean, it added the \"minister\" of foreign countries, that no ad hoc measures can be taken.\nAbout Swiss support for the Palestinian population, Cassis noted that Switzerland finances on-site 30 non-governmental organizations dealing with human rights or education. At the moment Bern does not intend to suspend aid, nor support for UNRWA, the United Nations organization that deals with aid to Palestinian refugees.\nWith the account of the victims who continue to rise from both sides involved in the conflict, the announcement of the Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant arrived on Monday of the suspension of water, electricity and gas in the Gaza Strip. The initiative is likely to trigger a humanitarian emergency of proportions never seen even in a territory in which, according to international relief organizations, at least two thirds of the population now depend to survive humanitarian aid. On Monday the United Nations Humanitarian Affairs Coordination Office (OCHA) announced that it would be 137,000 people displaced in Gaza.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nOn October 15 the Polish electorate is called to the urns. But a democracy expert has good reasons not to participate fully.\nArticles mentioned",

Guterres asks Israel to \"allow the entry into Gaza of essential goods. We need fast and barrier-free humanitarian access.\"\nMeanwhile, a truck sent by the Egyptian government with medical material and first-need goods marched back, after Israel communicated that it would open fire on the convoy. The Israeli Government has reiterated that the blockade will be interrupted only to the liberation of persons kidnapped and held hostage by Hamas. It would be 150, but there is no exact number because of the still imprecisated amount of missing.\nIn Gaza, a total of 339,000 people displaced, about 220,000 people are sheltered in 92 UNRWA facilities. The agency announced yesterday, Wednesday, that eleven people of his staff died following Israeli air strikes, and that 18 UNRWA schools currently turned into shelters were damaged by bombing.\nAlso from Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed that five people who worked for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) died in Gaza. The ICRC urged \"both the parties involved in reducing the suffering of civilians\".\nThe organization is in contact with Israel and Hamas on the question of persons held hostage. The regional director of the Committee for the Near and the Middle East, Fabrizio Carboni, said that \"as a neutral intermediary, we are ready to make humanitarian visits, to facilitate the communication between the hostages and the members of their families and to facilitate their release\". Taking hostages is prohibited by international humanitarian law and any person held must be released immediately, Carboni recalled.\nAlso the CRIC asks to stop the block of lifesaving goods: \"Without electricity, hospitals risk becoming obitoes,\" said Carboni. The UN press office confirmed yesterday, Wednesday, that the 13 health facilities in Gaza are working at the moment only partially, because of the lack of medical material and electricity. According to the BBC, the main hospital in Gaza City would only have four days of backup fuel for its generators. Without electricity for pumps, in addition, in some roads they would be accumulating crude slurry.\nIn the meantime, the international media struggle to understand what is true in the news, circulated on several newspapers also in Switzerland, that 40 children would have been killed, and some even beheaded, during the bloody break of Hamas in the kibbutz of Kfar Aza, a settlement a few kilometers from the Gaza Strip. The news was spread by Israeli journalist Nicole Zedeck, who, however, reversed in the face of the inspiring questions of colleagues and colleagues, who from all over the planet tried to verify the news. The journalist wrote about X (ex Twitter): \"some soldiers told me to believe that 40 children were killed, but the exact number of victims is not yet clear.\"\nThe Israeli military spokesman told the Turkish press agency Anadolu on Tuesday, which has a cooperation agreement with the Italian Ansa,\n.

Authorities, however, like those of other countries, are confronted with the blocking of passages to and from the Strip. To resolve the situation the president of the Swiss-Palestina association asks Bern to deal with Hamas, if necessary.\nIsrael has asked in recent days about a million people who live in the Strip to head south and many people have reached the Rafah Pass, but it is kept closed by Egypt. Hamas urged the people not to move. According to former MP Geri M\u00fcller, a deep connoisseur of the situation in Gaza, it is possible that the presence of binationals in the Strip is used by Hamas to obtain counterparts, said to the microphones of the Radiotelevision of Italian Switzerland RSI. And it is precisely with Hamas that we must treat, according to him, possibly asking for a truce. \"The solution could be that Switzerland - or other states that have citizens in the Gaza Strip or in the West Bank - treat with Hamas.\" An extremely controversial issue in the Confederation: \"Switzerland had contacts, which now wants to stop [refers to the change of route of the Federal Council that wants to designate Hamas as a terrorist organization, ndr]. It's probably not the ideal moment.\"\nThere are only three Swiss-Palestinian people in the West Bank who have so far been able to leave the territories, while for those in the Gaza Strip it will take more time.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nHasni Abidi's polythologist analyses the implications of the last migration agreement between the EU and Tunisia.\nArticles mentioned",

Sabato, inoltre, sarebbe atterrato in Egitto un velivolo ONU con tende di fortuna, scorte di acqua potabile e disinfettanti, strumenti per sale operatorie.

They call for a ceasefire \"immediate\", because \"the hospitals are overloaded with victims. The civilian population has more and more difficulty in accessing essential food supplies\" and Palestinian children and girls \"moving at an impressive pace\". On Saturday, the Palestinian Government has announced that 1'756 have died so far.\nOn the edge of the conference on the Middle East on Saturday in Cairo, the UN humanitarian emergency aid coordinator Martin Griffiths said that four WHO-organized trucks are directed to Gaza with medical material for injured people and suffering from chronic diseases. In addition to the drugs, he said, the WHO trucks would contain additional essential goods for tens of thousands of people in difficulty. Saturday, moreover, would land in Egypt a UN aircraft with curtains of fortune, stocks of drinking water and disinfectants, instruments for operating rooms. The WHO spokesman pointed out that there are 170 trucks loaded and ready to bring to the people of Gaza humanitarian auts - stopped at the Rafah Pass. On Saturday, 20 were allowed to cross the border with Palestinian Territories.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nGeneva is a world hotspot of espionage.
