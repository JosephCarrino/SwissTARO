                    "While for many countries a monthly salary of CHF4,000 ($4,364) would be seen as a good salary, in Switzerland this would push individuals and families to the brink of poverty. \u00a0",
                    "Rising rents, apartment shortages, inflation and now an increase in health insurance costs: people living in Switzerland may receive high salaries, but what is left over at the end of the month is dwindling.",
                    "Daniel Lauper, a sales manager at Caritas, an organisation which aims to prevent and alleviate poverty in Switzerland, says that since the Covid-19 pandemic the situation for many people and families has become precarious.\u00a0",
                    "The shame felt by those seeking assistance is painful. \u201cIn Switzerland, we don\u2019t talk about money, or that we don\u2019t have money,\u201d Lauper says. However, almost 750,000 individuals are affected by poverty.\u00a0",
                    "\u201cI get a lump in my throat whenever I think about the many more families who are on the brink. That number is not measurable,\u201d he says.",
                    "Lauper finds the precarious situation in which many families find themselves \u201calmost dangerous\u201d and worries what will come out of the frustration from the families who are not receiving the help they need. \u201cWe\u2019re not even talking about what will happen next year,\u201d he says. He expects even more individuals will seek assistance, as incomes next year will become significantly more stretched with rising health insurance premiums foreseen for 2024.",
                    "On Tuesday the outgoing health minister, Alain Berset, dropped a hammer on Switzerland. \u201cI have bad news for households already plagued by inflation,\u201d he said: health insurance costs are to rise by 8.7% in 2024.",
                    "This translates to an increase of CHF1,000 spent on health insurance for a family with two young children per year, reports the ",

                    "In Switzerland, individuals can apply for a health insurance premium reduction, allowing people struggling with costs to receive lower healthcare premium costs. The cantons then subsidies the healthcare premiums for those individuals who qualify.",
                    "However, economists say placing the financial burden on the cantons is not a viable long-term solution. Currently, Switzerland spends CHF5.5 billion on health insurance premium reductions, the equivalent of the budget of the Swiss army.",
                    "Tilman Slembeck, healthcare economist at Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW), told Swiss public radio, SRF, that without these health insurance premium reductions, Switzerland would have long had a \u201cnational uprising\u201d. Slembeck says that the cost of health insurance premium reductions being the equivalent to that of the army budget shows that the healthcare system in Switzerland is in \u201cdesperate need of reform\u201d.",
                    "Voices from all sides of the political spectrum are speaking out about these insurance spikes. Some are calling for a government-funded insurance system, paid for by taxes. However, Slembeck says that this is not a viable option for Switzerland as it goes against the Swiss culture.",
                    "A parliamentarian from the Green party says: \u201cA person working in upper management pays the same healthcare insurance premiums as a construction worker. This shows a lack of solidarity.\u201d",
                    "The left side of the political spectrum, particularly the Greens, are calling for an income-based healthcare cost system. However, Slembeck dismisses this as well, saying he sees \u201cno benefits\u201d. This would be putting a band aid on the problem, he says \u2013 it would relieve pressure on the government to undertake a much-needed reform of the Swiss healthcare system and, ultimately, would not solve the long-term issue.",
                    "To make matters worse, inflation, while lower than in most of Europe, remains high from a Swiss perspective and rent prices have been steadily increasing.\u00a0",
                    "The director of the Swiss Federal Office for Housing expects rents to rise by more than 15% between now and 2026. This as well as low vacancy rates, which fell from 1.72% in 2020 to 1.31% last year, and a growing population set to soon hit nine million are adding an additional strain.",
                    "While inflation has dropped from the 3.4% high it hit at the beginning of the year to 1.6% in August, domestic goods still cost 2.2% more than in 2022.",
                    "This drop in inflation is not felt back at welfare organisation Caritas in Bern. Caritas also helps to provide groceries and household goods at reduced prices, and Lauper says his Caritas shop in canton Bern has seen a 30% increase in families and individuals seeking assistance. \u201cMore families with children, like you and me, are coming to the shop. You wouldn\u2019t expect it,\u201d he says. His store is also experiencing more elderly individuals and more \u201cworking poor\u201d.",
                    "However, Switzerland is not alone in feeling the burden of inflation. The European Union saw a peak inflation of 11.5% in October 2022. This resulted in 21.6% of the EU population being at risk of poverty.",
                    "Will there be a small reprieve this winter for people living in Switzerland? Last year, due to the Russian aggression in Ukraine, there were concerns of a sudden jump in energy costs, as much of the gas imports used to heat Swiss homes came from Russia. The situation this winter should be better, experts say. But they warn that Switzerland still needs to invest much more to ensure a long-term energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables.",
                    "As Switzerland faces federal elections on October 22, the spill-over effect of the increase in the cost of living is sure to be at the top of the voter agenda.",

Funny how Gregory and Vera Mirlas were almost always early to every appointment, even here on the Riviera, their young friend joked, as he embraced the couple at their rendezvous in the chic French resort of Juan-les-Pins.",
                "content": [
                    "They strolled in the September heat across the town square, past the Parc de la Pin\u00e8de, for lunch at their favourite restaurant, Le Perroquet. The couple ordered lamb, as usual. Their friend went for grilled fish and a glass of ros\u00e9. They lapsed into gentle conversation, reminiscing and catching up.",
                    "But when the Mirlases began to tell their friend \u2014 a Goldman Sachs banker \u2014 about what had been happening with their savings, he began to worry. Something sounded completely wrong, he recalls. \u201cI left lunch worrying about them. And I got straight in touch with people I knew at their bank in Switzerland to try and set up a meeting to work out what had happened.\u201d",
                    "The Mirlases soon discovered they had been victims of an alleged fraud that took place under their noses and that of their bank, Julius B\u00e4r \u2014 one of Switzerland\u2019s most prominent private lenders. Four years later, they are still fighting for their money back in the courts.",
                    "Theirs is not an isolated case.",
                    "In Switzerland, the characteristics that have made the country such a haven for the rich to safely store their money \u2014 its secrecy, its deep conservatism and its stolid, inflexible institutions \u2014 can also sometimes turn into nightmarish liabilities when things go wrong. Banks refuse to back down or admit mistakes. Lawyers will not work against the banks that otherwise keep the Swiss legal profession so well remunerated. And regulators are too weak to act.",
                    "The Mirlases\u2019 names have been changed in this article at the couple\u2019s request. They said they feared becoming pariahs in Z\u00fcrich\u2019s tightly knit social scene, in which bankers dominate and critical outsiders can find themselves shunned for disrupting the status quo. In line with Swiss convention regarding defendants in criminal proceedings, the FT is also not publishing the full name of Benjamin G, their Swiss wealth adviser whom they accuse of fraud.",
                    "Gregory and Vera left the Soviet Union shortly before its collapse in November 1990. They took no luggage and had just $495 (CHF450) in cash. The decision to leave came quickly after the emigration law was liberalised under glasnost.",
                    "They had been motivated by the issues afflicting all Soviet citizens: the lack of freedom, the economic malaise and the rampant hypocrisy. But there was also, for the Jewish Mirlases, discrimination, says Gregory, who had worked as a mining engineer.",
                    "They arrived in Israel without a clear idea of their future \u2014 and got off to a bad start when they got lost on their first evening trying to find their way to the beach. But they had a stroke of luck. They ran into Kobi Richter, his wife and son, who were sitting in their car and offered them a lift.",
                    "Through the Richters, the Mirlases got their break. Gregory had found a job working at a medical start-up, developing stents. The work was a far cry from his experience, but the new problems tested his skills. It didn\u2019t last. After refusing to work outrageously long hours, Gregory was fired. Richter suggested Gregory simply set up his own company. The two founded Medinol that year.",
                    "The stents Gregory designed \u2014 at first making prototypes on wooden jigs at home \u2014 went on to become so successful that they remain the industry standard to this day. And they made the Mirlases (and the Richters) extremely rich.",
                    "In 1998, changes in Israeli law allowed citizens to legally keep their savings with foreign banks. For the Mirlases and their newfound millions, the question of where to do so seemed obvious: throughout their lives in the USSR, Switzerland and its banks had always held a particular place in the popular imagination, Gregory recalls. Nowhere could be safer.",
                    "Switzerland and its banks had always held a place in the popular imagination",
                    "When the Mirlases first met Benjamin G, he was employed by the Swiss arm of Britain\u2019s Lloyds Banking Group. He came with a recommendation from the Richters, and quickly proved helpful. He told the Mirlases he could get them Swiss work permits so they could move and work in a cooler climate. And he did.",
                    "In 2001, Benjamin left Lloyds to join Julius B\u00e4r, one of Switzerland\u2019s oldest private banks, and at the time still controlled by the B\u00e4r family of Zurich. He took the Mirlases with him.",
                    "B\u00e4r was changing fast, however. Soon, the B\u00e4r family would relinquish control and, as the bank moved to a Swiss exchange listing in an era of booming markets, it would join the advance guard of old Swiss institutions chasing the newly rich and their assets all over the world.",
                    "It was a time of huge opportunities, but also of pitfalls. Institutions that for decades had relied on trusted employees brought up in a conservative Swiss milieu now found themselves employing fresh, young and hungry bankers.",
                    "A new layer of middlemen emerged in Switzerland between banks and their clients. Initially, there was a logic to this. Swiss banks had begun to earn a reputation for pushing their own, sometimes unsuitable, in-house products to rich clients, rather than shopping around in the marketplace. The idea of a wealthy family signing up with an independent adviser, therefore, who could direct their investments to the right banks, made sense. In reality, however, the market was plagued with problems.",
                    "Swiss wealth advisers were almost always former bankers who had worked out that, if they could take five or so big clients with them, the advisory fees they could earn would be far more than their previous bonuses.",
                    "What\u2019s more, if their old banks \u2014 full of their old buddies \u2014 could perhaps pay a fee, then maybe they could direct their clients\u2019 investments back to that bank anyway.",
                    "This phenomenon became an almost institutionalised part of the Swiss wealth advisory world. The Swiss call such payments \u201cretrocessions\u201d.",
                    "While such payments exist elsewhere in the global asset management industry, in Switzerland they are not only more widespread, but also much larger \u2014 and, until just two years ago, they were completely secret.",
                    "The law in Switzerland now requires full disclosure of such payments, under the Swiss Financial Services Act of 2020 (FinSA) which came into force in January 2022. Financial advisers must also obtain a licence from the market regulator, FINMA. It is a step change for a financial ecosystem that was, until then, largely ungoverned.",
                    "So far, FINMA, has approved 950 firms (advising on CHF175 billion ($194 billion) of assets) out of just under 1,750 advisory firms that have applied for licences.",
                    "\u201cThe new regulation protects clients much more,\u201d says Nicole Curti, president of the Alliance of Swiss Wealth Managers and chief executive of Capital Y. \u201cBefore the new law, you could have been a hairdresser with a lot of wealthy clients and you could one day say you were going to be a wealth adviser and just do it.\u201d",
                    "She adds: \u201cIndependent wealth advisers in Switzerland now face the same constraints in terms of KYC [know your customer], transaction checking, internal audit and so on as the banks \u2014 which was not the case before.\u201d",
                    "Curti says adviser numbers are growing and will continue to rise \u2014 particularly as traditional private banks, faced with shrinking margins, cut back on attending to niche needs.",
                    "Others in the industry, however, are less positive about the new law.",
                    "Gabriele Gallotti is a Swiss-Italian private banker who has no relationship with the Mirlases. He left US bank JPMorgan to set up his own (licensed) advisory boutique, Novum, which manages just over CHF3 billion. While FinSA has been a welcome change, he says, it has definitely not led to an automatic alignment of wealth advisers\u2019 interests with those of their clients.",
                    "Gallotti suggests that if he followed the current Swiss industry standards that he sees at many licensed peer organisations, then Novum could probably triple its bottom line. He reels off examples of abuse. In September last year, a wealthy individual came to Gallotti with a question: how was his existing portfolio, managed by a prominent wealth adviser, down 2% over the past five years, in a bull market?",
                    "Gallotti checked. In the eight months prior, he discovered that CHF60 million of the portfolio, about a third, had been invested solely in structured products with one bank. The volume of those products traded during that period was CHF1.5 billion. In other words, the wealth adviser had been massively churning the portfolio and earning himself [or herself], and the bank they were working with, huge commissions.",
                    "In another recent example, Gallotti recounts the story of a senior international consultant with a strangely lacklustre portfolio. It turned out that they had been sold a high-fee structured product with an upside linked to an index performance. What they hadn\u2019t been told was that the fund tracking the index would have its dividends stripped out for the bank to keep.",
                    "In a third case \u2014 which, says Gallotti, shows the limitation of the new FinSA rules \u2014 members of a rich Italian family showed him their accounts with a wealth adviser in the canton of Ticino. The adviser had promised them minuscule fees \u2014 just \u20ac2,000 (CHF1,900) annually. But, in the reams of small print, it turned out they had completely waived their right to be told about the retrocessions the adviser might get from banks.",
                    "Gallotti says: \u201cThe misalignment of advisers with client interests here is systemic, and, well, if you find a client who is not very financially literate, a client who doesn\u2019t constantly check up on what is going on, a guy who doesn\u2019t know where to look, then it\u2019s the perfect set-up for advisers to screw their clients and overcharge, and for the banks they work with to enjoy the ride.\u201d",
                    "It\u2019s the perfect set-up for advisers to screw their clients and for the banks they work with to enjoy the ride",
                    "Gabriele Gallotti",
                    "In 2006, Gregory decided it was time to take a step back. Richter bought out his share of Medinol, and Gregory gave a large chunk of the proceeds to his friend Benjamin to manage. Gregory and Vera deposited $38 million at Julius B\u00e4r.",
                    "In 2010, Benjamin told the couple he was leaving B\u00e4r to set up as an independent wealth adviser at Constanza, an obscure wealth advisory partnership in the ultra-low tax canton of Schwyz, which he told them was effectively a daughter company of the bank.",
                    "The Mirlases let him take their money with him and he ran it freely for a decade.",
                    "On October 8, 2019, a month after they had met on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, the Mirlases sat down with their Goldman banker friend, at the opulent headquarters of Julius B\u00e4r, all polished wood inside, with recessed lighting, and sleek, uniformed service staff gliding between soundproofed meeting rooms.",
                    "Although Benjamin had not worked at the bank for years, Julius B\u00e4r was still used by him at Constanza to keep custody of the Mirlases\u2019 money. As custodian, the bank\u2019s role was to hold the assets, but it had no say in how they were invested, or spent.",
                    "The Mirlases\u2019 banker presented a file containing their latest account details.",
                    "Within a few minutes, it became clear there was a significant difference between what the Mirlases thought they had saved with the bank and what they actually had.",
                    "Unknown to them until that point, it appeared that Benjamin had been both giving and loaning himself huge amounts of money from their account, according to criminal proceedings later filed against him, and his own admissions in police interrogations.",
                    "The bank, in accordance with the power of attorney Benjamin had presented it with, had followed every instruction he had given it.",
                    "The Mirlases were shocked. Gregory studiously scribbled notes, perhaps hoping in doing so not to have to confront the enormity of what they were hearing.",
                    "\u201cBenjamin had been like a son to us,\u201d the couple later said. They spent weekends together, time in each other\u2019s homes. \u201cIt was humiliating, and very painful to think that all the time, we had been taken advantage of,\u201d says Vera.",
                    "The alleged theft began as far back as 2009, when Benjamin was still working at Julius B\u00e4r. But it allegedly ramped up after he became an independent wealth adviser. In 2011, he decided to become a partner in Constanza, and used CHF4mn of the Mirlases\u2019 own money to buy into the business, by acquiring his stake from a Russian businessman.",
                    "Over the course of a decade, the Mirlases believe Benjamin secretly misappropriated around CHF22 million of their assets. He allegedly passed them doctored Julius B\u00e4r statements, stripped of detail, which appeared to show their assets growing. He kept the full accounts, which Julius B\u00e4r had dutifully agreed to send to him alone, from them.",
                    "The Mirlases allege that a luxury house Benjamin bought himself in Z\u00fcrich\u2019s most exclusive enclave, the lakeside suburb of Herrliberg, was at least partially paid for with their money. He also acquired an apartment on the Italian lakes, and a CHF1.5 million yacht using their savings, they say.",
                    "For the past four years, to no effect so far, the couple have tried to get some of the money stolen from them back. What has shocked them above all, they say, is Julius B\u00e4r\u2019s complete unwillingness to take any responsibility for what happened.",
                    "\u201cThey saw every transaction he made,\u201d says Gregory.",
                    "Julius B\u00e4r says, in response to questions about the Mirlas case, that it never comments on private client matters (under Swiss law, it is a criminal offence to do so).",
                    "What has shocked them above all is Julius B\u00e4r\u2019s unwillingness to take any responsibility",
                    "Earlier this year, Benjamin was indicted on charges of embezzlement by Z\u00fcrich\u2019s cantonal prosecutor. Shortly before this article went to print, in early October, he was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison, 18 months to be served and 18 months suspended. He was ordered to pay the Mirlases more than CHF13 million back, as well as CHF4 million to the state.",
                    "In the interrogation files the police submitted to the court, seen by the FT, Benjamin admitted he had taken the Mirlases money to fund his personal lifestyle, but said that it had been his intention to pay it back. He has also said that several millions of Swiss francs he took were intended for legitimate investment opportunities of the kind the Mirlases had long entrusted him to undertake.",
                    "Benjamin\u2019s lawyer said he would appeal the verdict. \u201cOur client rejects [the] allegations and is fully committed to fight them in all instances,\u201d they said. The Mirlases were \u201caware and duly informed\u201d of the transactions Benjamin made on their behalf, the lawyer added.",
                    "As well as the criminal case against Benjamin, the Mirlases are suing him in the civil courts and have opened a case for damages against Julius B\u00e4r. They have also filed a complaint with FINMA, the regulator, asking it to look into the bank for breaches of compliance and facilitating money laundering. FINMA has not declared whether it will pursue the case.",
                    "A senior lawyer who works for a private bank in Zurich says that, although egregious, the situation was hardly novel: it is widespread practice in Switzerland that independent wealth managers are given full power of attorney by clients.",
                    "\u201cWe have clients where, basically, the authorised representatives, their financial advisers, do things like go and buy an expensive watch or whatever, and if we say, \u2018No, don\u2019t do that\u2019, we will hear something back asking us why on earth we are making a fuss . . . They say they have given these people these powers, and it\u2019s not up to us to decide what is reasonable or not.\u201d",
                    "What\u2019s more, the same lawyer notes, if a bank is only being paid relatively small custody fees, and clients have willingly signed over powers of financial advice and portfolio management to a third party, then why should the bank be responsible for policing transactions?",
                    "By their own admission, the Mirlases had not visited Julius B\u00e4r for more than ten years, and had not received a statement directly from the bank in more than six. At no point did they check up on what was going on \u2014 a quiescence the bank took to be a legitimation of Benjamin\u2019s activities.",
                    "FinSA, according to the law\u2019s supporters, is a major step forward for Switzerland. But there are still question marks, as it is unclear how well FINMA will be able to police compliance. The regulator said in a statement that it has \u201cbuilt up its resources extensively\u201d to license and monitor wealth advisers.",
                    "Responsibility for ongoing compliance, however, does not reside with FINMA professionals, at least not in the first instance. Instead, five self-appointed industry bodies \u2014 comprising members of, and paid for by, the industry itself \u2014 have been granted the status of \u201csupervisory organisations\u201d with whom wealth advisers must register.",
                    "FINMA said: \u201cSupervision is within the responsibility of the so-called supervisory organisations. If those supervisory organisations have exhausted their measures of ongoing supervision without success, FINMA is responsible for intensive supervision and enforcement.\u201d",
                    "For critics, this is a well-intentioned system, but which easily lends itself to abuse. \u201cThe problem is, there will always be some black sheep,\u201d says one investment adviser, who is keen to defend his profession in Switzerland. \u201cAnd ultimately, it\u2019s about clients doing their homework as well.\u201d",
                    "\u201cDoes it help? Yes definitely,\u201d says Gallotti. \u201cBut is this the end point? No, definitely not. Sadly, I think it might well take another big scandal, another big financial crisis even, for things to change properly.\u201d",

Louis Charbonneau, UN Director of Human Rights Watch, tells Inside Geneva he thinks some countries in the Global South are \u201cgrowing tired\u201d of the war in Ukraine, and want to move on. Russia, he points out, sells useful things; weapons, fuel, agricultural goods. And, he sighs, \u201cthere\u2019s a large number of countries in the world who don\u2019t care about or are hostile to human rights \u2013 they don\u2019t care about the war crimes.\u201d",

                    "To achieve that goal, Katzarova says we must avoid the kind of lazy judgement, seen quite often in the western media, that all of Russia, and all Russians, are the enemy. \u201cWe cannot treat all Russians with this blanket approach: the Russians are responsible, there is no such thing! I'm a human rights expert, I don't believe in group guilt of any sort.\u201d",

Gold traders, regulators, academics, and NGOs that focus on the environmental and human rights impact of gold mining and processing also attended.",
                    "A networking force of nature, Beck is passionate about the flow of metals across time and space. Her journey began with a PhD in archaeometry \u2013 which draws on scientific methods to resolve archaeological mysteries \u2013 and deep dives into topics such as silver production in Switzerland\u2019s Wallis region in ancient times.",
                    "At the University of Lausanne, in partnership with Swiss refinery Metalor, Beck developed a scientific approach to validate the origin of dor\u00e9, a bar made of precious metals including silver and gold, that is sent to refineries for further purification. The so-called Geoforensic passport, which was unveiled in May 2022, is now routinely used to test dor\u00e9 bars that arrive at Metalor\u2019s refinery in Marin-Epagnier, in canton Neuchatel in western Switzerland. It identifies the chemical composition of the gold to confirm its source.",
                    "Other Swiss refiners have also taken interest in her method, which builds on existing processes for precious metal analysis used by refineries when they perform routine chemical testing of dor\u00e9 to assess its gold content.",
                    "Refiners \u201chave to pay for the gold, pay the suppliers, and they need to know the gold content,\u201d explains Beck. \u201cIt\u2019s important to know whether a bar contains 50% or 90% gold.\u201d",
                    "Refiners also test the dor\u00e9 for other elements that interest them \u2013 like silver and copper \u2013 as well as those that do not, deleterious elements such as selenium or arsenic that refiners don\u2019t like because they are either toxic or more complicated to separate in the refining process.",
                    "As her method uses the analyses that are already done systematically on dor\u00e9 bars when they arrive at the refinery, there is no extra cost involved, she says. \u201cWhat I can do with my software is determine right away whether this dor\u00e9 is consistent with other dor\u00e9 from the same supplier or not. When it does not conform, then the audits begin.\u201d",
                    "Dor\u00e9 bars reflect the chemical composition of a mine [hence the notion of a geoforensic passport]. This allows Beck to distinguish one dor\u00e9 from another by performing a chemical analysis. The method also allows analysis of changes over time. \u201cA dor\u00e9 that comes from a mine two years ago does not have the same signature as a dor\u00e9 today,\u201d notes Beck. \u201cYou see an evolution over time in the chemical composition.\u201d",
                    "Another solution focusing on the most challenging stretch of the supply chain was developed by Zurich-based GeoBlock, a data management company specialising in upstream gold production analytics. Its co-founder, entrepreneur Bruno Regli, has worked in the gold sector since 2009, initially with a focus on mining operations in Colombia. In 2019, he began looking for a solution to provide traceability that starts at the mine, drawing on tests that he conducted at his gold mine in Colombia and others in his network.\u00a0",
                    "\u201cWe started with gold because we think there is a demand from the banks and the refiners to really know the origin,\u201d says Regli.",
                    "In the old days, he explains, gold miners would use a spectrometer to read copper, silver, and gold. Today there are next generation spectrometers with a CHF50,000 price tag that allow for richer analysis. GeoBlock\u2019s traceability solution combines analysis of metal elements with statistical calculations to verify that gold originates in a specific geography.",
                    "\u201cGeology is different all over the world,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe analyse all possible elements, often around 40. The machine-learning algorithm tells me which ones are the most significant for testing and which ones follow through the whole supply chain: from the extraction until the dor\u00e9 or to the refinery.\u201d The analysis allows him to verify that a metal comes from a particular area.\u00a0\u00a0",
                    "How precise is the technology? \u201cOn the tests we did in Colombia, we could already see differences between [gold] veins that are 500 to 800 metres apart, location wise,\u201d Regli says.",
                    "Ultimately, though, it boils down to probability. \u201cWe can tell the refiner this material is coming from this area,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously we cannot tell you if it is coming from the left-hand side or the right-hand side of the river. If the geology is totally different, you can even see it with your own eyes. In fact, usually, with proper visualization, it's obvious without a statistical test whether material is fake or not.\u201d",
                    "\u00a0A few kilometres \u2013 or just a few hundred metres \u2013 can mean the difference between a legal and illegal mine, a distinction that is one of the biggest headaches of the gold supply chain in Brazil, one of South America\u2019s major producers.\u00a0 \u00a0",
                    "In 2021, Switzerland was the largest buyer of Brazilian gold ($1.26B), just behind Canada, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.",
                    "But mining in the Amazon region is having a deleterious impact on the land and local indigenous populations. The environment is being polluted due to the use of mercury to extract the precious metal through the process of amalgamation, deforestation is destroying natural habitats, and organised crime is pervasive across the value chain.",
                    "Stretching across nine countries, the vast Amazon rainforest accounts for one third of the world\u2019s tropical forests, which are vital for the health of the planet. \u201cIllegal gold mining kills and threatens indigenous peoples, it threatens our forests and therefore threatens our future,\u201d Raul Jungmann, president of the Brazilian Mining Association (IBRAM) and a former minister, told the conference in Lausanne.",
                    "In 2022 Swiss refiners pledged not to take gold from the Amazon but this is a difficult promise to keep. Efforts at due diligence have been complicated by the sheer size of the rainforest and a \u201cgood faith\u201d approach to sourcing \u2013 declarations by gold sellers of where the gold was mined are accepted at face value.",
                    "Between 2015 and 2020, Brazil traded 229 tons of gold that showed evidence of illegality, according to a study by the Sao Paulo-based sustainability organisation Instituto Escolhas. The majority of the gold traded by Brazil in 2021 (52.8 tonnes or 54% of national production) may have been illegal, according to the same source. Deforestation was rampant under former president Jair Bolsonaro.",
                    "A change in government in Brazil this year has ushered in tighter controls on the gold trade and pushed environmental and indigenous concerns up the national agenda. The Gold Provisional Measure, adopted in April, ended good faith sales and mandated electronic invoices for buying, selling, and transporting gold within the country.",
                    "Brazilian gold trader Andrei Santos, who exports 250 to 300 kilos of gold per month to Switzerland, has doubts about the effectiveness of physical traceability solutions, based on personal experience. \u201cRegionally, I think the idea [of a gold DNA] is beautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cYou cannot get gold from let\u2019s say Cuiab\u00e1 and have the same gold characteristics as gold produced in Venezuela. But for me, that does not guarantee where the gold is actually from.\u201d",
                    "Cuiab\u00e1 is the capital city of the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, which is part of the Amazon region and where his office is based. In one instance, DNA analysis led him to incorrectly conclude that one of his suppliers was smuggling gold from another region. The usual output of this gold producer was 92%-97% gold with few contaminants. But one day the gold produced had different properties: 85% gold, 5% led, 3% iron and some silver.",
                    "So he took a team to the site to investigate. \u201cI stayed there the entire day, I saw the gold being produced,\u201d says Santos, one of MKS Pamp\u2019s suppliers. \u201cLong story short, I was wrong. Why? Because it is nature. It is not that precise\u2026 Gold is not a mathematical equation.\u201d",
                    "Achieving compliance and peace of mind takes many resources and steps, he says. His compliance department accounts for 40 of the 85 people in his office, and he uses a software programme to flag irregularities. A red light might flash if a mine, typically producing five kilos per month, suddenly sells 15 kilos to the company in one month. A separate company sends geologists to mining sites with GoPro cameras, much like police officers, to carry out checks.",
                    "\u201cAll our mines are under this constant process of monitoring,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I want inside my company is 100% traceability\u2026 What DNA, what traceability solution can guarantee to me [that the gold] did not come to me from that [illegal] area? It\u2019s not that precise. It is not spot on.\u201d",
                    "Back in Switzerland, refiners stress the distinction between transparency and traceability. They say it is possible to have a traceable supply chain without necessarily being transparent about everything, arguing that revealing their sources would compromise their competitiveness.",
                    "At the conference in Lausanne, the CEO of one Switzerland-based refinery proposed that refineries should communicate with the public about the systems and technologies in place but not share their actual data. \u201cWe should not reveal our sources, but we should communicate about the systems we have in place to ensure that the sources we have are clean,\u201d he said during a focus group discussion.",
                    "Those in law enforcement take a different perspective and see traceability solutions as key to supporting their work. \u201cWhat is important for us is to be sure that the data is confirmed, is a mirror of reality,\u201d said Sylvie Bertrand, the public prosecutor for Geneva, a major hub for Swiss gold traders, during another panel discussion.",
                    "It is also important for law enforcement officials to have the tools that enable them to read and process the data, and then use it to confront their partners\u00a0and those suspected of illegal activity, she added. At the end of the day, a court needs to be able to understand the data when presented with a case.",
                    "Traceability is key for regulators as it allows them to link all the necessary details, said Thomas Brodmann, head of the central office for Precious Metals Controls, which enforces Swiss regulation on gold.",
                    "\u201cYou must be able to link the gold from that Amazon region to that exact refinery,\u201d he told the panel at the Lausanne conference on the feasibility of institutionalising traceability. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t go directly from Brazil to Switzerland but goes through several different countries, and it is melted together, then it becomes very difficult, almost impossible [to make those linkages].

And secondly, I\u00a0don\u2019t think that the Swiss government gets much sympathy from countries that have been invaded, like mine. Estonia was a\u00a0neutral country, and in\u00a01939-1940 it\u00a0was invaded first by\u00a0the Russians, then by\u00a0the Nazis, and then once again by\u00a0the Russians.

Why do\u00a0they [Russian soldiers in Ukraine] have to\u00a0import [back home] massive amounts of\u00a0refrigerators and washing machines? It\u2019s because they can\u2019t get the chips to\u00a0put into their guided missiles. So,\u00a0in\u00a0that sense, yes, the technological sanctions seem to\u00a0have had an\u00a0effect there. And it\u00a0seems Russia is working very hard to\u00a0get around the sanctions on oil. Sanctions take a\u00a0while to\u00a0have an\u00a0effect.

                    "The only thing that [Vladimir] Putin respects is\u00a0force and power. What we\u00a0really need to\u00a0do\u00a0is\u00a0to\u00a0stop dithering. We\u00a0have come a\u00a0long way since last February when Germany gave 5,000\u00a0helmets [to Ukraine]. But it\u2019s quite clear that without serious military support, the Ukrainians can\u2019t win. We\u00a0would have had massive destruction in\u00a0Kyiv if\u00a0the Ukrainians had not had Patriot missiles to\u00a0shoot down the missiles that were directed at\u00a0them. We\u00a0need firm support from the West. Here, again, the West has been playing the self-deterrence card. Putin makes threats about using nuclear weapons and then everyone says, \u2018Oh no, we\u00a0can\u2019t let the Ukrainians get more equipment\u2019. Then slowly the West realises that if\u00a0we\u00a0give them anti-tank missiles and the anti-missile missiles, then it\u00a0doesn\u2019t start World War Three. And more importantly, the West does not sufficiently realise that if\u00a0you do\u00a0not help Ukraine, then you can throw out the past 80\u00a0years of\u00a0international law, because basically Putin is\u00a0saying to\u00a0the civilised world:\u00a0\u2018I can invade and there are no\u00a0consequences.\u2019",
                    "I\u00a0don\u2019t think it\u00a0makes sense to\u00a0de-escalate right now. Because that means allowing Russia to\u00a0keep and\u00a0further strengthen the defense of\u00a0territory it has illegally occupied. I would say that we\u00a0need the opposite now \u2014 a\u00a0very strong push to\u00a0liberate occupied Ukrainian areas, especially as we\u00a0know that wherever they occupy territory they commit the most horrible war crimes. So when\u00a0I hear people saying, \u2018We\u00a0should de-escalate and have a\u00a0ceasefire\u2019, that\u2019s basically saying: \u2018Go\u00a0ahead, Russia, rape, kill, torture\u2019. So\u00a0de-escalation is\u00a0something you can say if\u00a0you\u2019re sitting in\u00a0a bath and having a\u00a0ros\u00e9. But we\u2019re talking about torture victims and rape victims.",

In\u00a0this country, everybody has a\u00a0relative or\u00a0a\u00a0grandparent, someone who has suffered under Soviet Russian rule. People call the Estonian prime minister [Kaja Kallas] a\u00a0\u2018hawk\u2019. Her mother was six months old when [in\u00a01940] she was deported in\u00a0a\u00a0cattle car to\u00a0Siberia and was in\u00a0Siberia until she was seven years old, and only then came back to\u00a0Estonia. So we\u00a0have experience and this kind of patronising attitude of\u00a0people who have never gone through this, telling\u00a0us that we\u00a0don\u2019t know how to\u00a0deal with Russia, is\u00a0obnoxious. It\u2019s disgusting.",
                    "Well, I\u00a0mean the inability of\u00a0especially Westerners, European politicians to\u00a0understand what is\u00a0happening and discounting the experiences of\u00a0what people in\u00a0the East have gone through. This has bothered me\u00a0since I read a\u00a0review in\u00a0",

Often it is not so much the realities that determine what happens, but the perceptions. Already now, the perception is that if the Republicans win, there will be a massive shift of Western support that will definitely affect NATO\u2019s planning for military support.

You may have concerted conversations on integrity and sovereignty, and talks about security issues and a ceasefire. There will be all sorts of topics that will come up and will be shaped at the time.

At that point, some 70,000 Ukrainians should be able to return home, 80% of them voluntarily; most are families who were separated due to the men remaining in Ukraine.

                    "Switzerland is ready to provide diplomatic support to the parties and the states in the region to work towards de-escalation. It is committed to a two-state solution negotiated by both parties in accordance with international law, Cassis said. In his view, it is likely that Iran was behind the attack, as it was very well orchestrated.",
                    "Bern\u2019s stance towards Hamas has nonetheless been criticised by many politicians and organisations in Switzerland. On Monday the Switzerland-Israel parliamentary group called on the government and parliament to reconsider their position and their relations with Hamas, and also with the Iranian regime.",
                    "\u201cOur legal situation does not currently allow us to list terrorist organisations,\u201d Cassis pointed out. This does not mean that we cannot act against terrorists, he added, referring to the procedure against al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, which are banned by law.",
                    "While the EU has announced that it is freezing its development aid to the Palestinians, Switzerland is maintaining its financial support for the time being. There is no indication that these funds are not being properly used,\u201d Cassis said.",
                    "Switzerland funds the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), as well as around 30 NGOs at present. As for the controversial aid to UNRWA, there is no alternative. Until now, Switzerland has supported the relief agency to the tune of around CHF20 million ($22 million) a year.",
                    "The first priority is to support the Swiss people on the ground, Cassis said. For the time being, he had no information about Swiss victims or hostages. Foreign ministry staff in both Tel Aviv and Ramallah are safe and the Swiss embassy in Tel Aviv and the representation office in Ramallah remain operational.",

A return evacuation flight between Zurich and Tel Aviv will be operated at the request of the foreign ministry. It was already fully booked on Monday. However, SWISS is cancelling all flights to and from Tel Aviv until Saturday October 14 inclusive.",

It called for the immediate release of the Hamas hostages and an immediate end to the violence.",

Even though Hamas has been designated a terrorist organisation by the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and the European Union (EU), previous attempts by Swiss parliamentarians have all failed. \u00a0",

Hence, Switzerland will need to create a special legislation which would need to be approved by parliament,\u201d Marco Sass\u00f2li, professor of international law at the University of Geneva told SWI swissinfo.ch. \u00a0",
                    "Even then it is unlikely to be a permanent ban. Despite the fact that al-Qaeda and the so-called Islamic State were designated terrorist groups by the United Nations, the Swiss government could only institute temporary bans on them that have to be renewed every few years. \u00a0",
                    "Then there is the practicality of implementing a ban. Switzerland contributes around CHF20 million a year to the regular budget of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and to around 30 NGOs on the ground in Palestine (CHF5 million in 2022). According to Sass\u00f2li, it would be near impossible to guarantee that all these organisations have nothing to do with Hamas. \u00a0",
                    "\u201cWe all condemn the attack by Hamas but they still run the Gaza strip. If you want to deliver food, medicine or help children there you will have to speak to Hamas. You cannot fly in by helicopter!\u201d says Sass\u00f2li.\u00a0",

However, the recent attack prompted an urgent review of the EU\u2019s assistance to Palestine. \u00a0",
                    "\u201cOur humanitarian support to the Palestinian people is not in question. Yet it is important that we carefully review our financial assistance for Palestine. EU funding has never and will never go to Hamas or any terrorist entity. So we will now again review the entire portfolio in light of an evolving situation on the ground,\u201d said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen ",

                    "Declaring Hamas a terrorist organisation could also affect Switzerland\u2019s ability to serve as a mediator or messenger in the Middle East. The Alpine nation\u2019s neutrality has made it a trusted partner in the region with neutral Switzerland currently representing the diplomatic interests of Iran in Egypt and Canada, the US in Iran and Iran in Saudi Arabia (and vice versa). \u00a0",

                    " Switzerland's previous engagement with Hamas, despite its global perception, allowed it to mediate previous conflicts and negotiations effectively due to its neutral stance. The shift towards declaring Hamas a terrorist organisation contradicts Switzerland's historical neutrality and mediating role. It potentially hampers its capacity to navigate and mediate future regional conflicts and negotiations, such as releasing hostages or facilitating dialogues between conflicting parties.\u202f\u202f\u00a0",
                    "R.B: Switzerland should leverage its traditional neutrality and play an intermediary role without siding with either Israel or Palestine. It's plausible to acknowledge that both parties may have committed war crimes, as seen in Hamas's actions and Israel's responses. Switzerland can provide valuable service by cautioning against potential intensifications, such as a land invasion by Israel in Gaza, while highlighting the risk of further escalating war crimes. But to execute this, the Swiss foreign ministry\u00a0must possess the requisite strength and resolve, which is a concern given its current perceived weakness.\u202f\u00a0",
                    "R.B: After the Oslo Accords in 1993 (signed between Israel\u202fand the\u202fPalestine Liberation Organization), Switzerland developed a cadre of diplomats who effectively engaged in Palestine. Today there is no longer that political will. There are fewer Swiss diplomats, and they are less well prepared. This poses a substantial problem for Switzerland's diplomatic endeavours in the region.\u202f\u00a0",

Thus, Switzerland should steadfastly support UNRWA, the only UN agency dedicated to assisting Palestinian refugees with humanitarian aid, unlike UNHCR, which mandates legal protection. It\u2019s crucial to note that the region\u2019s over six\u00a0million Palestinian refugees lack legal protection from any agency, making them uniquely vulnerable globally.\u202f\u00a0",

Allegations that Hamas is diverting money destined for aid cannot be substantiated. The allocation of international assistance in Gaza has evolved into a sophisticated mechanism, ensuring thorough checks regarding the recipients and expenditure of the funds. The European Union, which contributes significant financial assistance, utilises a specific mechanism,\u202fcalled PEGASE, to ensure funds reach the intended associations and institutions.

These include a \"one democratic state solution\", a \"bi-national state\" and a \"federation\". However, discussing these options in detail and moving towards any of them is currently challenging due to the ongoing war.

                    "R.B:\u202fIt's about the juridical and constitutional architecture of the state. Israel, defining itself as a Jewish democratic state without a complete constitution, navigates delicate religious and political balances. A \"one democratic state\" would necessitate equal status for all citizens, both Jewish and Palestinian, and a defined constitution ensuring equal rights. In contrast, a \"bi-national state\" might provide different political structures for both national groups but needs careful planning to avoid internal conflicts and ensure equitable representation and rights for all. Exploring these models requires careful consideration of the diverse religious and political perspectives present in the region.\u202f\u00a0",
                    "A \"bi-national state,\" implies recognising the right to self-determination for both Israeli Jews and Palestinians, a point which, surprisingly, has never been officially declared. In its 2018 nation-state bill,\u202fIsrael declared that only Jewish Israelis have the right to self-determination.\u202fHowever, the right to self-determination was vital during decolonisation in other regions like Africa and India.\u202f\u00a0",
                    "R.B: Reflecting on past efforts, such as those following the Oslo Accords, there is a significant lesson about the importance of rigorous adherence and enforcement of international law in peacebuilding processes. Despite agreements, actions such as the substantial increase in land confiscation by Israel after 1994 occurred without significant international intervention or consequence. There was a failure from Europe and the United States to ensure that the involved parties adhered strictly to international law and norms. The substantial takeaway is holding entities accountable. They need to uphold legal and ethical standards by allowing neither geopolitical nor diplomatic relationships to soften the insistence on lawful and fair practices in international conflict resolution.\u202f\u00a0",

                    ".",
                    "The subdued obituaries and the impossibility of any kind of public celebration \u2013 due to the health restrictions \u2013 of Raetz\u2019s life and works left a gap which the Bern Museum of Fine Arts (Kunstmuseum Bern) is now attempting to fill.\u00a0A large retrospective is running until February 25, 2024. Some of Raetz\u2019s most well-known three-dimensional artworks are on display next to a spatial installation,\u202f",
                    "(Clouds, 2020), planned by the artist but never executed.\u00a0",
                    "More than half a century of industrious activity left a broad range of experiments with materials, surfaces\u00a0and techniques. If one were to define Raetz\u2019s work in a word, it would certainly be \u201cperception\u201d. Or, more precisely, \u201caltering perceptions\u201d, but not restricted to the psychedelic exhortations of the term that was all the rage among many of his contemporaries in the 1960s and 1970s.\u00a0",
                    "In fact, he was very much an artist of his time, having also surfed the lysergic waves of the 1960s counterculture. Raetz opened what British writer Aldous Huxley called the \u201cdoors of perception\u201d and dove deep into its essential meaning, or the nature of perception. The main question throughout his career, according to his widow, Monika, was: \u201cis this the only way to see things?\u201d\u00a0",
                    "The exhibition in Bern answers this question, artwork by artwork, with a clear \u201cno\u201d.\u00a0",
                    "The Swiss critic Max Wechsler wrote in 1984 in the ",
                    "that \u201cthe art of Markus Raetz can be defined in a fundamental way: as the tension between intelligence and sensibility [\u2026]\u00a0growing out of this tension is a kind of force field which sets everything else in motion and allows the art to appear in all its ambiguity of meaning\u201d.",
                    "Raetz\u2019s works demand a certain interaction of the viewer, as changes of perspective lead to different perceptions of the pieces. The apparent simplicity of the works \u2013 sometimes consisting of just a torn wire \u2013 conceals careful studies on the optical effects of materials and forms. His brother, a physicist, also played a role in Raetz\u2019s mathematical calculations.\u00a0",
                    "Raetz was a relentless drawing machine. He always had a sketchbook on hand that served as an illustrated journal of his reveries and studies. Some of the sketches, displayed now in Bern, can be contemplated as artworks themselves. For the artist, drawing was always the first step in making all his works, including sculptures.\u00a0",
                    "Raetz was very fortunate to be at the right place at the right time. The Swiss capital, Bern, where he was born in 1941, grew up and eventually died, has never been a global artistic focal point \u2013 except for a brief period in the 1960s when pioneer curator Harald Szeemann ran the local Kunsthalle (1963-69). That coincided with the moment when Raetz decided to leave his teaching career to devote himself to art.\u00a0",
                    "At the time, Szeemann transformed Bern into one of the leading centres of the avant-garde, culminating with the milestone exhibition \u201cWhen Attitudes become Form\u201d. Its radicality and the predominance of conceptual art eventually cost Szeemann his job in Bern.\u00a0\u00a0",
                    "Raetz was one of the local artists who fell under Szeemann\u2019s spell during that decade. He accompanied the curator in some of his other international shows, such as the documenta 5 in Kassel, Germany (1972) \u2013 another milestone in the history of 20th-century art.\u00a0",
                    "Szeemann\u2019s influence went beyond his singular personality and artworks. The ambience created by the curator fostered myriad connections between Swiss artists and the global avant-garde, bringing art movements such as pop art, conceptualism, situationism, Fluxus and Neo-Dada closer to home.\u00a0",
                    "Raetz also struck up an intense friendship with the grande dame of Swiss art, Meret Oppenheim, who had moved to the Swiss capital in 1967 to mix with that young, wild crowd.\u00a0",
                    "When the Bern scene began to wither in 1969, Raetz and his wife Monika moved to Amsterdam. This period abroad, marked by extensive travels while living in a much more inspiring environment than stiff Switzerland, consolidated Raetz\u2019s working methods and interests.\u00a0",
                    "Raetz returned for good to Bern in 1976, after a couple of years spent in Carona, a tiny village in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino and Meret Oppenheim\u2019s favourite haunt until her death (she\u2019s also buried there). He had by then become one of the most prolific Swiss artists, with a constant flow of exhibitions in the main European capitals.\u00a0",
                    "In the mid-1980s, Raetz had his breakthrough in the American scene thanks to a solo exhibition in the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York (1988). That same year, he represented Switzerland at the 43rd\u202fVenice Biennale. \u202f\u00a0",
                    "Before turning 50, Raetz was already an established name on the Swiss and international art circuits, but notoriety for him simply meant the possibility of working constantly on a steady output that defied not just the perception of the artworks but also of spaces.",
                    "His 3D objects play with the perception of their exhibition sites\u00a0\u2013 expanding, compressing or distorting them. Many of them also enter into dialogue with Raetz\u2019s most affectionate influences, such as the Belgian surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte, the American photo-artist Man Ray, or Mickey Mouse.\u00a0",
                    "It is maybe still too early to make a comprehensive assessment of Raetz\u2019s importance in the universe of contemporary art. But he certainly epitomises some peculiar characteristics shared by a handful of Swiss artists who shot to fame abroad, like Fischli & Weiss, Max Bill, Meret Oppenheim or Alberto Giacometti.",
                    "We could mention the deceptive simplicity that leads to various interpretations and layers of meaning; a constant quest for the essence of materials and the human experience; the playful arrangements of words and concepts. But none of these can be attributed to any kind of \u201cSwiss way\u201d of making art, not even Raetz\u2019s prolific work ethos, similar to his contemporary ",
                    " for whom \u201cart is just work\u201d.",
                    "The clich\u00e9s of Swiss Protestant-Calvinist mores, though, do not apply to Raetz\u2019s art. Even if it provokes a smile rather than a laugh, it reflects the quiet joy that Raetz displayed while conceiving and making his pieces. It\u2019s a lot of work, yes, but fundamentally it\u2019s fun and pleasure.",

And, for a time, it seemed as if no job in global banking, let alone in Switzerland, was beyond him.",

Pictet may be Switzerland\u2019s most prestigious bank, but it is also one of its most conservative, where decision-making happens in secret and by consensus. For Pictet, Collardi offered an irresistible route into Asia, thanks to his contacts there. And for Collardi, Pictet offered one of the biggest pay cheques in Switzerland.",
                    "It was not to last. In August 2021, the partners, Collardi included, decided their newest member should go. Collardi is reluctant to be drawn on the detail. It was a bad cultural fit, he says.",

Asian clients of Swiss banks in particular, he says, are now wondering whether that neutrality actually means anything at all. \u201cPeople are surprised. Even shocked . . .

                    "As for the suspicions of financing a terrorist organisation, the question must be clarified whether Hamas is a terrorist group according to the Swiss Criminal Code, Bl\u00e4ttler said.

                    "Asked about a Swiss investigation into terrorist financing that was initiated 20 years ago and, according to SRF, was closed without charges, Bl\u00e4ttler said it was difficult to prove the individual elements of the offence.",
                    "On October 11, the Swiss government announced its intention to classify Hamas as a terrorist organisation and have it banned. A task force reporting directly to the government is to examine the legal options for doing this.",

Zurich airport is a model of efficiency. And Nice is worth looking at with regards to travel. Finally, Geneva deserves recognition for its sustainable development.\u00a0",

If easyJet decided to go somewhere else, which I think unlikely, the gap would be filled soon enough, when you think of the demand there is from our catchment area. Obviously, the adjustment would take a while.\u00a0",

We are rather a \u201cpoint-to-point\u201d airport, so we depend completely on our local population. Our aim is to keep working in the long term to get more intercontinental routes and increase on our present range of 12 such destinations. \u00a0",

Moreover, Geneva airport has one unusual characteristic: most tickets sold are first and business class, which means greater profitability for the airlines. \u00a0",
                    "A.S.: An airport needs to take a whole range of interests into account, and the complexity of our structure makes us consider all these interests whenever a new idea is to be implemented. On the other hand, Zurich\u2019s corporate structure means it can give priority to shareholder value. But in the end, Zurich is an airport that also has to work with its surrounding community, with the local population areas and the political level as well. \u00a0\u00a0",

Ce rendez-vous majeur de la vie politique helv\u00e9tique est pourtant boud\u00e9 par une majorit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9lectorat et ne suscite que peu d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des m\u00e9dias et du monde acad\u00e9mique au-del\u00e0 des fronti\u00e8res nationales.",

                    " et y a fait de riches d\u00e9couvertes.",
                    "Zo\u00e9 Kergomard: C\u2019est inh\u00e9rent au fonctionnement du syst\u00e8me politique helv\u00e9tique, marqu\u00e9 par le f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme et les instruments de la d\u00e9mocratie directe. On a l\u2019impression que ce n\u2019est pas \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que se joue la destin\u00e9e du pays, mais plut\u00f4t lors des votations populaires. Ce qui me frappe, avec mon regard de chercheuse fran\u00e7aise install\u00e9e en Suisse, c\u2019est que m\u00eame ici il n\u2019y a pas un fort int\u00e9r\u00eat pour ces \u00e9lections.",
                    "Pourtant, ces campagnes \u00e9lectorales sont un moment particulier dans la vie d\u00e9mocratique du pays pendant lequel les partis politiques se mettent en sc\u00e8ne et tentent de cr\u00e9er du lien avec les citoyens et les citoyennes. Contrairement aux votations populaires qui portent sur une question claire, les partis ont ici une page blanche pour mettre en avant les id\u00e9es qui les int\u00e9ressent.",
                    "Cela donne un instantan\u00e9 du d\u00e9bat politique dans le pays. Mais surtout, lorsqu\u2019un parti met \u00e0 l\u2019agenda une question sp\u00e9cifique \u2013 la protection de l\u2019environnement \u00e0 partir des ann\u00e9es 1960 d\u00e9j\u00e0, l\u2019immigration, particuli\u00e8rement depuis les ann\u00e9es 1980, etc. \u2013 cela peut avoir des effets \u00e0 long terme sur l\u2019agenda m\u00e9diatique et politique.",
                    "Si l\u2019on prend le cas de la France, on est quand m\u00eame face une d\u00e9mocratie qui ne va pas tr\u00e8s bien, comme on l\u2019a vu cette ann\u00e9e avec les tensions autour de la r\u00e9forme des retraites. La participation est certes encore assez \u00e9lev\u00e9e lors de l\u2019\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle, mais elle d\u00e9cline \u00e0 toutes les autres \u00e9lections car les citoyens et citoyennes n\u2019y voient plus de sens. C\u2019est le revers de la m\u00e9daille de l\u2019hyper-pr\u00e9sidentialisation de la Cinqui\u00e8me R\u00e9publique.",
                    "En Suisse, au vu du grand nombre de scrutins, l\u2019abstention est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement intermittente: nombre de citoyennes et citoyens votent quand le sujet des votations les int\u00e9resse. Si la mont\u00e9e de l\u2019abstention dans les ann\u00e9es 1960-1970 avait fait d\u00e9bat \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, depuis, la relativement faible participation \u00e9lectorale en Suisse s\u2019est presque normalis\u00e9e et n\u2019est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme le signe d\u2019une d\u00e9saffection d\u00e9mocratique.",
                    "Il y a tout de m\u00eame une question qui revient r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement quand on se pr\u00e9occupe pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de la question de la participation: qui peut s\u2019impliquer dans la vie politique suisse et qui en reste exclu?",
                    "La proposition d\u2019\u00e9tendre les droits politiques aux jeunes de plus de seize ans est par exemple sur la table depuis quelques ann\u00e9es. En outre, les campagnes \u00e9lectorales suisses donnent \u00e0 voir la particularit\u00e9 d\u2019un pays \u00e0 forte immigration o\u00f9 pr\u00e8s d\u2019un quart de la population n\u2019a pas le droit de vote au niveau f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, cons\u00e9quence d\u2019une politique de naturalisation parmi les plus restrictives d\u2019Europe. L\u00e0 aussi, cette question donne r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement lieu \u00e0 d\u00e9bat.",
                    "O\u00f9 que l\u2019on se situe sur cette question, on peut penser que cette exclusion a des cons\u00e9quences sur la participation politique en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Dans les lieux de sociabilit\u00e9 comme le travail ou les associations, on parle forc\u00e9ment moins de politique si une partie plus ou moins importante du groupe ne peut pas participer.",
                    "C\u2019est un des paradoxes de la vie politique suisse: la politique est tr\u00e8s visible dans l\u2019espace public, mais les grands d\u00e9bats politiques ne sont pas forc\u00e9ment pr\u00e9sents dans les interactions quotidiennes de la population.",
                    "Les partis politiques, qui ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient pas de financement \u00e9tatique, sont historiquement faibles en Suisse, particuli\u00e8rement en comparaison avec les plus grands groupes d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat. On a pu dire que cette faiblesse des partis et le syst\u00e8me de milice conduisent \u00e0 des campagnes peu professionnalis\u00e9es.",
                    "Mais, derri\u00e8re les partis, les associations \u00e9conomiques jouent un r\u00f4le depuis longtemps tant dans les campagnes de votation que dans les campagnes \u00e9lectorales. En outre, le syst\u00e8me de listes ouvertes incite les candidates et candidats \u00e0 investir dans leur propre campagne.",
                    "Cette diversit\u00e9 des acteurs impliqu\u00e9s dans les campagnes \u00e9lectorales a longtemps rendu difficile l\u2019\u00e9valuation pr\u00e9cise des d\u00e9penses de campagne. Pour la premi\u00e8re fois cette ann\u00e9e, de nouvelles r\u00e8gles sur la transparence du financement de la vie politique s\u2019appliqueront aux \u00e9lections f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Il sera tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant d\u2019en \u00e9tudier les retomb\u00e9es.",
                    "Effectivement, c\u2019est un contraste marquant avec les d\u00e9cennies 1940 \u00e0 1980. Reste que les variations de voix se font davantage entre partis politiquement proches que d\u2019un bloc \u00e0 un autre. D\u2019autant que le syst\u00e8me partisan est particuli\u00e8rement divers en Suisse, comme on peut le voir avec l\u2019existence de deux partis \u00e9cologistes, l\u2019un plus critique, l\u2019autre plus favorable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9conomie de march\u00e9.",
                    "Les pratiques de campagne utilis\u00e9es par l\u2019UDC ne sont pas in\u00e9dites. D\u00e8s les ann\u00e9es 1950, les partis ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler plus ou moins \u00e9troitement avec des sondeurs et des publicitaires. Et il y a de fortes continuit\u00e9s dans les pratiques de mobilisation: les partis utilisent ainsi les affiches depuis les ann\u00e9es 1920 pour \u00eatre visibles dans l\u2019espace public.",
                    "Le caract\u00e8re pol\u00e9mique des campagnes de l\u2019UDC n\u2019est pas non plus nouveau. En 1979, le Parti radical avait par exemple men\u00e9 une campagne qualifi\u00e9e d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u2019\u00abam\u00e9ricaine\u00bb, autour du slogan d\u2019inspiration n\u00e9olib\u00e9rale \u00abplus de libert\u00e9, moins d\u2019\u00c9tats\u00bb. Et pendant la guerre froide, l\u2019anticommunisme, tr\u00e8s fort en Suisse, a souvent servi \u00e0 stigmatiser les partis de gauche.",
                    "Les attaques personnelles ponctuent \u00e9galement l\u2019histoire des \u00e9lections f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019introduction du suffrage f\u00e9minin au niveau f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en 1971, les premi\u00e8res candidates ont ainsi fait l\u2019objet de d\u00e9nigrements sexistes dans la presse ou encore de lettres anonymes appelant \u00e0 rayer leur nom des listes.",
                    "Les discours autour de la culture du \u00abconsensus\u00bb ont certainement un effet mod\u00e9rateur sur les comportements des acteurs politiques. En 2007, tant l\u2019usage de la violence que les outrances x\u00e9nophobes de la campagne de l\u2019UDC en question ont \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9s.",
                    "De tels incidents ne sont pour autant pas uniques, particuli\u00e8rement dans le turbulent contexte des mouvements protestataires des ann\u00e9es 1960-1970. De jeunes apprenties et apprentis du groupe Hydra accompagn\u00e9s de travailleuses et travailleurs italiens avaient par exemple perturb\u00e9 une r\u00e9union \u00e9lectorale du tribun d\u2019extr\u00eame droite James Schwarzenbach en 1971, revendiquant par l\u00e0 une place dans la d\u00e9mocratie suisse.",
                    "Bref, les campagnes \u00e9lectorales suisses ont souvent \u00e9t\u00e9 bien plus mouvement\u00e9es qu\u2019on l\u2019imagine g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, et mettent en jeu de grands enjeux d\u00e9mocratiques: qui participe, qui repr\u00e9sente qui, quels probl\u00e8mes politiques seront prioritaires dans les ann\u00e9es \u00e0 venir.",

                    "Au niveau national, le Parti socialiste r\u00e9alise la deuxi\u00e8me plus forte progression derri\u00e8re l\u2019UDC (+1,2 point, \u00e0 18% des voix). A l\u2019\u00e9tranger, c\u2019est lui qui obtient les gains les plus marqu\u00e9s (+2,8 points, de 17,6% \u00e0 20,4% de part \u00e9lectorale).\u00a0",
                    "Le principal changement dans le vote des Suisses r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger en 2023 semble ainsi \u00eatre un report sur le Parti socialiste des voix qui \u00e9taient all\u00e9es aux Vert-e-s en 2019.\u00a0",
                    "Faut-il alors en conclure que les Vert-e-s ont perdu la confiance de la population expatri\u00e9e? \u00abJe ne pense pas que les Vert-e-s aient fait quelque chose de mal\u00bb, estime Martina Mousson. \u00abEn g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les partis de droite ont davantage de chances de tirer leur \u00e9pingle du jeu dans des situations mondiales incertaines\u00bb, explique-t-elle. Pour la politologue, les \u00e9cologistes ont probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de la conjoncture mondiale cette ann\u00e9e, alors qu\u2019ils en avaient tir\u00e9 profit il y a quatre ans.\u00a0",
                    "En revanche, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui s\u2019observe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale, on ne peut pas dire que l\u2019UDC ait triomph\u00e9 dans les urnes du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des Suisses expatri\u00e9-es.\u00a0",
                    "Le parti de droite conservatrice, premi\u00e8re force politique du pays, qui a aussi connu la plus forte progression cette ann\u00e9e (+9 si\u00e8ges et 28,6% des voix, en hausse de 3 points), r\u00e9alise \u00e9galement une hausse au-del\u00e0 des fronti\u00e8res helv\u00e9tiques, mais plus mod\u00e9r\u00e9e: de 18% \u00e0 18,5% des voix de la diaspora.\u00a0",
                    "L\u2019UDC reste la deuxi\u00e8me force politique chez les Suisses de l\u2019\u00e9tranger, mais avec des scores qui restent nettement plus bas que ceux r\u00e9alis\u00e9s au niveau national.",
                    "La question de savoir si l'UDC peut franchir la barre des 30% se pose r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement en Suisse. \u00abElle s'en approche toujours, mais n'y est jamais parvenue, rel\u00e8ve Martina Mousson. Il existe manifestement un plafond pour l'UDC, tant en Suisse qu\u2019\u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger\u00bb. Seul l\u2019avenir dira \u00e0 quel point cela est grav\u00e9 dans le marbre.\u00a0",
                    "L\u2019\u00e9lectorat suisse de l\u2019\u00e9tranger est traditionnellement plus lib\u00e9ral et plus \u00e0 gauche que le reste du pays. \u00abCe n'est pas nouveau, c'est pourquoi je ne suis pas surprise que la progression de l'UDC n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plus importante\u00bb hors des fronti\u00e8res, commente la sp\u00e9cialiste.\u00a0",
                    "Dans l\u2019ensemble, la mani\u00e8re dont la diaspora a vot\u00e9 pour ces l\u00e9gislatives tend \u00e0 confirmer cette tendance. A eux deux, les principaux partis de gauche (PS et Vert-e-s) ont recueilli pr\u00e8s de 39% des votes (contre 27% pour l\u2019ensemble de la Suisse); la force additionn\u00e9e des partis \u00e9cologistes (Vert-e-s et Parti vert\u2019lib\u00e9ral) s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 30% \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger (contre 17% en Suisse).\u00a0",
                    "Pour les autres partis, les scores restent relativement stables. Le Centre gagne 0,9 point, une hausse proche de celle r\u00e9alis\u00e9e au niveau national (+0,8 point). Pour le parti lib\u00e9ral-radical \u00e9galement, l\u2019\u00e9volution est sensiblement la m\u00eame au sein de l\u2019\u00e9lectorat expatri\u00e9 que pour le reste de la Suisse: la formation de droite perd 0,6 point (contre 0,7 dans l\u2019ensemble du pays).\u00a0",
                    "La participation des Suisses de l\u2019\u00e9tranger est comme souvent rest\u00e9e faible: elle s\u2019est \u00e9lev\u00e9e dans l\u2019ensemble \u00e0 18,7%, en baisse dans quasiment tous les cantons \u00e0 l\u2019exception de B\u00e2le-Ville et Saint-Gall. Au niveau national, elle a en revanche l\u00e9g\u00e8rement progress\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 2019, de 45,1% \u00e0 46,6%.",
                    "43 Suisses de l'\u00e9tranger se pr\u00e9sentaient pour ces \u00e9lections f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Sans surprise, aucune de ces candidatures n\u2019a transform\u00e9 l\u2019essai. N\u00e9anmoins, les r\u00e9sultats de deux membres de la diaspora se distinguent.\u00a0",

Pas moins de 12\u2019451 Bernoises et Bernois ont vot\u00e9 pour ce socialiste de 61 ans, qui travaille \u00e0 la Croix-Rouge suisse. Ce bon r\u00e9sultat par rapport aux autres Suisses de l'\u00e9tranger peut s\u2019expliquer par le fait que son nom figurait sur la liste principale des hommes socialistes bernois. Pascal Cuttat r\u00e9alise cependant le moins bon r\u00e9sultat de sa liste.\u00a0",
                    "A Gen\u00e8ve, le Vert Rudolf Berli a remport\u00e9 un succ\u00e8s d'estime. Avec 11'947 voix, il arrive en quatri\u00e8me position de la liste des \u00e9cologistes du canton. Le mara\u00eecher de Pougny (France) a obtenu 4271 voix en seule ville de Gen\u00e8ve et 999 voix de l'\u00e9tranger.",

                "content": [
                    "Zwei Mitarbeitende des Staatsarchiv Fribourg, Lionel Dorthe und Rita Binz-Wohlhauser, haben w\u00e4hrend sechs Jahren die verschiedenen Register und Dokumenten von 360 Hexenprozessen untersucht, die zwischen 1493 und 1741 vor dem Gericht der Stadt Fribourg verhandelt wurden. Das Archiv, das seit letztem Jahr online zug\u00e4nglich ist, wurde nun in zwei B\u00e4nden von der Rechtsquellenstiftung des Schweizerischen Juristenvereins herausgegeben.",
                    "Das Interesse an diesen Dokumenten geht \u00fcber den lokalen Rahmen hinaus. \"Normalerweise beschr\u00e4nken sich die Nachforschungen auf einen ganz bestimmten Zeitraum oder ein ganz bestimmtes Ereignis\", h\u00e4lt Lionel Dorthe fest. Alle Hexenprozesse \u00fcber einen so langen Zeitraum dokumentiert zu haben, sei eine Premiere und k\u00f6nne als Vergleichsmassstab f\u00fcr andere Regionen der Welt dienen.",
                    "In der \u00d6ffentlichkeit werden Hexenprozesse oft mit dem Mittelalter und der Inquisition in Verbindung gebracht. Das ist aber nur teilweise richtig. \"Es besteht das Vorurteil, dass diese Verfolgungen aus dem Mittelalter stammen und dass die Kirche sich darum gek\u00fcmmert hat, aber in Wirklichkeit handelt es sich um ein Ph\u00e4nomen w\u00e4hrend des Ancien R\u00e9gimes\", sagt Dorthe. Im Zeitraum vom\u00a016. bis 18. Jahrhundert h\u00e4tten die meisten Prozesse in Europa und sogar in den USA stattgefunden. \"Und sie wurden fast ausschliesslich von weltlichen Gerichten gef\u00fchrt.\"",
                    "\"Das Ph\u00e4nomen der Verfolgung taucht zwar zu Beginn des 15. Jahrhunderts auf, dem letzten des Mittelalters\", r\u00e4umt der Experte ein. Damals seien d\u00e4monologische Abhandlungen verfasst worden und man habe begonnen, an die Bildung einer satanischen Sekte zu glauben, die der christlichen Gesellschaft feindlich gesinnt gewesen sei. \"An der Basis war es tats\u00e4chlich die Inquisition, die meist von Dominikanern geleitet wurde, die begonnen hatte, Menschen wegen Hexerei zu verfolgen.\"",
                    "Die weltlichen Obrigkeiten, die von Anfang an in den Prozess involviert waren, \u00fcbernahmen jedoch bald das Ruder und waren schnell bereit, Menschen wegen Hexerei anzuklagen.",
                    "Das Ausmass des Ph\u00e4nomens ist unterschiedlich. Wenn man einige verschwundene Register ber\u00fccksichtigt und die Prozesse in den Vogteien einbezieht, kommt man f\u00fcr den gesamten Kanton Fribourg auf rund 1000 Prozesse in 250 Jahren. Das waren durchschnittlich vier pro Jahr, was kein Massenph\u00e4nomen darstellt. Im Kanton Waadt waren es im gleichen Zeitraum 3000 Prozesse.",
                    "\"Die Intensit\u00e4t war nicht in allen Regionen Europas gleich\", best\u00e4tigt Dorthe. Wo die Macht nicht gesichert gewesen sei, wie etwa im Waadtland unter bernischer Herrschaft, nutzten die Richter ihre Kompetenzen im Kampf gegen die Hexerei. \"Es ist typisch: Je weniger Macht man hatte, desto mehr nutzte man sie\", so Dorthe. Aber in Regionen mit mehr Macht, wie Fribourg oder Frankreich, habe es keine Konkurrenz um die Vorrechte der Justiz gegeben und die Hexenprozesse seien keine politischen Waffen gewesen.",
                    "Die Fribourger Archive zeigen, dass eine Anklage wegen Hexerei fast jeden treffen konnte. \"Nat\u00fcrlich gab es Personen, die dem Klischee entsprachen: Etwa eine \u00e4ltere Frau, die allein lebte und als Heilerin arbeitete\", sagt Dorthe. Aber es habe kein typisches Profil gegeben. Es traf auch M\u00e4nner und sogar Kinder. \"Auch die soziale Herkunft war vielf\u00e4ltig: So gab es einen Schlossherrn, der als Richter in einer Vogtei t\u00e4tig war, und selbst Hexenprozesse gef\u00fchrt hatte.\"",
                    "Die Expert:innen vermeiden in diesem Zusammenhang den feststehenden Begriff \"Hexenjagd\", weil das Ph\u00e4nomen in einem Drittel der F\u00e4lle auch M\u00e4nner betraf. Aber auch, weil der Begriff \"Jagd\" ein willentliches und gezieltes Vorgehen der Beh\u00f6rden suggeriert. \"Das Ph\u00e4nomen ist jedoch komplexer\", stellt der Archivar fest. \"Ohne die Beteiligung der Bev\u00f6lkerung, eines Verwandten oder von Nachbar:innen und ohne den Glauben an Teufel und Magie w\u00e4re es nicht so weit gekommen\".",
                    "\"Der Vorwurf der Hexerei war ein Ventil, um das Ungl\u00fcck der Zeit oder pers\u00f6nliche Missgeschicke zu erkl\u00e4ren\", sagt Dorthe. Ein ideales Mittel, um einen unliebsamen Nachbarn oder eine zu aufdringliche Schwiegermutter loszuwerden. \"Starb ein Kleinkind, wurde versucht, den Schuldigen oder die Schuldige zu finden, vor allem, wenn es sich um eine Hebamme oder einen Heiler handelte.\" Habe ein Bauer festgestellt, dass die Leistung seiner K\u00fche nachliess, habe er ebenfalls nach einem S\u00fcndenbock gesucht.",
                    "\"In Fribourg, wo die Milchwirtschaft wichtig war, wurden immer wieder Nachbarn beschuldigt, mit Zauberei den K\u00fchen die Milch abzuzapfen und sie in die Euter ihrer eigenen Tiere zu leiten\", erz\u00e4hlt Dorthe.",
                    "Mit Hexenprozessen verbindet die \u00d6ffentlichkeit oft Szenen von Folter und Tod auf dem Scheiterhaufen. Diese Vorstellung ist nicht falsch, die damalige Justiz war hart, aber nicht unbedingt blind.",
                    "Die Richter wandten zwar Folter an, aber nicht systematisch. Ausserdem war sie nur ein Werkzeug. \"Die Folter existierte, um die Arbeit der Justiz zu unterst\u00fctzen\", erinnert Lionel Dorthe. \"Wir m\u00fcssen jeden Anachronismus vermeiden, indem wir unsere Emotionen und \u00dcberzeugungen \u00fcber die der Vergangenheit stellen.\"",
                    "Man d\u00fcrfe die Richter nicht als Sadisten betrachten. Sie h\u00e4tten ihre Arbeit machen m\u00fcssen, und die damaligen Gesetzestexte h\u00e4tten ihnen erlaubt, Folter anzuwenden, \"um Zungen zu l\u00f6sen\".",
                    "Am Ende des Prozesses stand nicht unbedingt der Tod. In den meisten F\u00e4llen (40%) endeten die Prozesse mit der Verh\u00e4ngung der \u00e4usseren Verbannung \u2013 die verurteilte Person musste den Kanton verlassen \u2013 oder der inneren Verbannung \u2013 der oder die Verurteilte wurde auf seine Kirchgemeinde beschr\u00e4nkt und durfte diese nicht verlassen. In weniger als einem Drittel der F\u00e4lle (30%) wurde die Todesstrafe verh\u00e4ngt.",
                    "Bei Hexereiverbrechen erfolgte der Tod durch Verbrennen auf dem Scheiterhaufen. Bei der H\u00e4lfte der 80 in Fribourg verzeichneten Hinrichtungen wurde die Strafe \"gemildert\". Damit die verurteilte Person nicht durch die Flammen starb, wurde sie zun\u00e4chst erdrosselt. Manchmal wurde ihr auch ein S\u00e4ckchen mit Schiesspulver um den Hals gelegt, das explodierte und dem Tod durch Verbrennung zuvorkam.",
                    "Heute wird die Verfolgung wegen des Verbrechens der Hexerei als ein Ph\u00e4nomen dargestellt, das ausschliesslich Frauen betraf. Diese Darstellung wird jedoch von den Archiven nicht gest\u00fctzt. \"Die feministische Figur der Hexe entspricht in keiner Weise den historischen Quellen\", stellt Dorthe fest. Die Vorstellung, dass die Hexe eine unabh\u00e4ngige Frau gewesen sei, die den Hass des Patriarchats auf sich zog, sei falsch.",
                    "\"Diese Feminisierung des Ph\u00e4nomens hat ihren Ursprung in 'La sorci\u00e8re', einem Essay von Jules Michelet\", so Dorthe. Dieser franz\u00f6sische Historiker des 19. Jahrhunderts habe die Hexe in ein ideales oder idealisiertes Opfer verwandelt, in eine Figur, die gegen jede Autorit\u00e4t gek\u00e4mpft habe. \"Dieses Bild entsprach eher den sehr romantischen Sehns\u00fcchten des 19. Jahrhunderts als den historischen Tatsachen. Viele Feministinnen haben dieses Bild der emanzipierten oder emanzipatorischen Hexe ab den 1960er-Jahren wieder aufgegriffen.\"",
                    "Diese Vereinnahmung st\u00f6rt den Experten allerdings nicht. \"Als Wissenschaftler kann man das skandal\u00f6s finden, weil es nicht der Realit\u00e4t entspricht\", sagt Dorthe. Aber f\u00fcr die Wirksamkeit des Diskurses, den man heute f\u00fchren wolle, sei es zweifellos sinnvoller, ein Symbol zu verwenden als eine grosse Rede dagegen zu halten.",
                    "\"Wir leben in einer Gesellschaft, in der die Emotion \u00fcber die Vernunft siegt\", so der Experte. Grund daf\u00fcr seien die sozialen Netzwerke. \"Es ist daher wirkungsvoller, eine fast vertraute Figur wie die Hexe zu verwenden, auch wenn diese Figur weit von der historischen Realit\u00e4t entfernt ist.\"",

                    "It all began in 1980, when Yoko Ono gave John Lennon a gift for his fortieth birthday. It was a Patek Philippe watch with a perpetual calendar and moon phases, made of 18-carat gold, model 2499. On the back, she had engraved a quote from a song the couple had written together after a period of separation.\u00a0",
                    "This model of watch is rare. It was produced between 1950 and 1985, no more than nine of them being made per year. Since then, Patek Philippe 2499 has become a collector\u2019s item. At the time of its purchase, this watch was worth about $75,000 (CHF68,400), whereas in 2018 a similar watch was sold at Sotheby's for $3.9 million. \u00a0",
                    "\u201cWhatever happened to the last birthday present John Lennon got? It\u2019s a mystery,\u201d wrote the French magazine Le Point in 2014. \u201cIf the mythic Patek Philippe of a legendary artist were to re-appear some day, given the rarity and complexity of the model and its origin, its value would be simply inestimable.\u201d\u00a0",
                    "A court decision dated June 7, 2023 by the Geneva civil court reveals what actually happened to this mythic watch. After Lennon\u2019s death, the judgement explains, the watch passed to Ono. The latter kept it in a locked room in her apartment in the Dakota Building in New York, along with other items of value that had belonged to the murdered star.\u00a0",
                    "Enter Koral Karsan. He was a Turk who had been the Japanese sculptor\u2019s private chauffeur for ten years. He was one of the few people to have access to all the rooms in her home. But in 2006, he broke that relationship of trust \u2013 he tried to blackmail her. Convicted by an American court, he was deported to Turkey.\u00a0",
                    "Koral Karsan is now believed to have taken with him several items that had belonged to Lennon without the widow\u2019s knowledge: diaries, tapes of concerts, spectacles \u2013 and the watch. In 2010, these items were handed over to another Turkish national, known as Erhan G. He later sold them to the German auctioneers\u2019 firm Auctionata AG.\u00a0",
                    "For a long time, Ono suspected nothing. But in 2017, Auctionata went bankrupt. A lawyer making an inventory of their stock found the items that had belonged to Lennon, and informed the police. The widow stated that she had not given these items to Karsan, although he had declared she had. There was now a criminal investigation. This concluded with a German court in 2019 sentencing Erhan G. to a year in prison, suspended, for receiving stolen goods.\u00a0",
                    "He was shown to have transferred 86 items belonging to Lennon to Auctionata, while being aware that these had likely been stolen. As for the ex-chauffeur, he is still in his native Turkey, which refuses to extradite him.\u00a0",
                    "That was not the end of the matter, for a number of items were still unaccounted for, including the missing watch. It was in fact sold by Auctionata for CHF600,000 to a person known as A., a \u201ccollector of watches and long-time professional in the industry, who describes himself as a \u2018world authority on timepieces\u2019, an Italian national, resident in Hong Kong\u201d.\u00a0",
                    "At the time of the sale in November 2013, Patek Philippe provided a statement to Auctionata that the watch was indeed Lennon\u2019s. Yet the company did not tell Ono that it had been called upon to authenticate this item.\u00a0",
                    "It was only in June 2014, when A. sent the watch to a company in Geneva to have it valued, that this company contacted Ono. The widow asked that it be held pending restitution to her.\u00a0",
                    "There now followed a legal battle between Ono and the collector. In A.\u2019s view, the watch was not stolen, \u201cand even if it had been, New York law required [Yoko Ono] to take action within a period of three years.\u201d She had \u201cnever declared this watch stolen and took no steps to recover it\u201d.\u00a0",
                    "The court in Geneva rejected his arguments, pointing to the conviction of Erhan G. in Germany. \u201cSince the watch was not given to Koral Karsan, he acquired it illegally, so that his possession of it was illegal from the outset,\u201d the court found, and concluded that Ono is the item\u2019s rightful owner.\u00a0",
                    "\u201cAccordingly there is no need at all to resolve the issue whether A. was acting in good faith when he acquired this watch. His own expert status as represented on his internet site, according to which he is a \u2018world expert on collectable watches\u2019, casts doubt on this, since he acquired a watch which he claimed in the course of this case to be worth between CHF200,000 and CHF400,000 for the sum of CHF600,000, whereas specialised auction houses estimate the value at CHF4,000,000.\u201d\u00a0",
                    "Ono was represented by Mich\u00e8le Wassmer and Vincent Guignet, who are part of the law firm Borel & Barbey. Contacted by Gotham City, they were unwilling to comment on the case, which is actually still before the courts. The Italian collector has appealed to the Swiss Federal Court.\u00a0",
                    "As for the whereabouts of the famous watch, the decision by the Geneva court says that it is still in Geneva, \u201cbeing held for safe keeping\u201d by B., the lawyer representing A. It will stay there \u201cuntil there is agreement or further order on the matter\u201d.\u00a0",

It separated children from their parents under its \u201cCharity for the Children of the Road\u201d project. How are these children coping today? Here is a look back at a dark chapter in Swiss history.",
                "content": [
                    "A pile of files sits on the dining table in Uschi Waser\u2019s flat in Holderbank in canton Aargau. They are just a few of the many that Waser has accumulated over the course of her life. Waser is a member of the Yenish community, a nomadic people present in western Europe.",
                    "But her past has turned her into an archivist. Carefully, she takes a yellowing\u00a0sheet from one of the folders and places it on the table. The paper looks as though it was once folded up very small, and it is slightly torn at the edges. \"Motherly love?\" is typed at the top in narrow letters.",
                    "\u201cI wrote this poem when I was fifteen,\u201d says Waser, who is now 71. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine. You can't get much lonelier than that.\u201d",
                    "At the age of 15, Waser had already experienced 25 different homes, clinics and foster families. She was taken away from her mother when she was barely 18 months old. After that, she never spent more than a few months at a time with her.",
                    "The initiative for her removal came from the \u201cCharity for the Children of the Road\u201d (Hilfswerk f\u00fcr die Kinder der Landstrasse), which was founded in 1926 at the initiative of Dr\u00a0Alfred Siegfried of Pro Juventute. The aim of this \u201ccharitable\u201d programme was to take Yenish children from their families to \u201csettle them\u201d and combat the \u201cevil of vagrancy\u201d.",
                    "Vagrancy was perceived not only as a cause of child \u201cneglect\u201d, but also as a danger to society. Between 1926 and 1973, when this so-called \u201ccharity\u201d was dissolved, 586 Yenish children were torn from their families due to its interventions. Waser was one of them.",
                    "\"My mother was an easy victim for Pro Juventute,\" she says. Waser's mother had herself been taken away from her parents by the charity as a child. As a single mother of four children, she was overwhelmed, and she beat them. \u201cBut she was also literally hunted down and driven into a corner by Pro Juventute,\u201d Waser says. So in 1952, as soon as Waser was born, Siegfried did everything he could to gain custody of the girl. He wanted \u201cat all cost\u201d to prevent \u201ca new line of vagrants\u201d from emerging.",
                    "Waser was no better cared for in the homes to which he sent her than she was in her own, however. Punishments and beatings were routine. \u201cI will never forget lying on a table as a child, being held down by two sisters while the third beat me with a carpet beater.\"",
                    "For years, her mother tried to win back custody of her children. With no success. Waser was shunted from one home to the next. It was a fate she shared with many other \u201cchildren of the road\u201d. The result was upheaval and loneliness; even friendships were difficult. If two girls got along well together, they were separated as quickly as possible.",
                    "She did not find a loving home. The Erziehungsheim zum Guten Hirten (Good Shepherd Reformatory), where she spent several years, offered only \u201crepression, unkindness, loneliness,\u201d Waser says. \u201cI would never have belonged there.\u201d Every evening she prayed fervently \u201cdear God, give me a father and a mother.\u201d",
                    "\u201cI prayed so much, enough for a lifetime,\u201d she says.",
                    "The \u201ccharity\u201d drew on the eugenic and racist concepts of \u201cvagrant research\u201d. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Chur psychiatrist Josef J\u00f6rger was one of the first to compile lists of names and family trees of Yenish families to prove the genetic \u201cdegeneration\u201d of \u201cvagrant families\u201d. This so-called Sippenarchiv (clan archive) was later used for psychiatric reports. J\u00f6rger also supported a policy of settling travellers and destroying their way of life, because he hoped this would improve the gene pool of these families. This view was taken up by the \u201cChildren of the Road\u201d project.",
                    "In foster families, the children were to be raised to become \u201csettled citizens\u201d. However, most children grew up in care homes or institutions because too few foster families could be found. A childhood in care remained a stigma for those affected throughout their lives. \u201cI always glossed over my biography,\u201d Waser says. \"I was afraid that I wouldn't find work as a child from a care home.\u201d",
                    "Life for anyone who was classified as \u201cdifficult to educate\u201d by their guardian was particularly hard, because they had to go to a forced labour or work education institution, such as the Etablissements de Bellechasse in Sugiez, canton Fribourg. This prison, which rises above a bleak plain of endless vast fields, accommodated more than 100 \u201cchildren of the road\u201d who had never committed a criminal offence. This incarceration was justified as welfare. For the most part, the children in social care were housed separately from the juvenile offenders.",
                    "However, the agricultural work they had to do and the living conditions were almost the same as for the juvenile offenders. And society did not distinguish between the different reasons someone had been in Bellechasse. The general view was that \u201cno one ends up in prison without a valid reason\u201d.",
                    "As early as the 1940s, Yenish people turned to the media to complain about the charity\u2019s practices. But they were given no credence until the 1970s, when a wide-ranging debate on care homes broke out. In 1972, the first articles appeared in the ",
                    " newspaper. In 1973, 50 years ago, the Charity for the Children of the Road was dissolved under public pressure.",
                    "An era of political awareness and identity-building for the Yenish people followed. Numerous associations were founded. But above all it was a time of searching. Two or three generations of Yenish families had been torn apart and destroyed by the charity. People began searching for parents, siblings and lost children. Venanz Nobel, a Yenish man from Basel, remembers this time well.",
                    "\u201cBack then, people turned up at stands every day and asked if anyone knew their family,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery year, two or three people still contact me.\u201d",
                    "His father, Sepp Nobel, was taken away from his parents as a child and had grown up with a foster family. In his father's files, they later found a handwritten note from Siegfried. He wrote that he was conducting an experiment by taking this boy out of the travelling milieu and giving him to a settled alcoholic. Significantly, the Nobel family were considered \u201ctravellers\u201d despite their permanent residence - because of their Yenish origins. That happened to many settled Yenish families at the time.",
                    "Sepp Nobel had a stroke of luck in this unfortunate situation. The \u201csettled alcoholic\u201d died, and his foster mother raised him lovingly. She also told him straight out that he was descended from \u201cgypsies.\u201d He wanted to know more. \u201cEvery year, my father travelled to Zurich to Pro Juventute and asked them to tell him who his parents and siblings were,\u201d Venanz Nobel says. But they refused to provide information, and at some point his father gave up the search.",
                    "It was only when Venanz Nobel became interested in his Yenish origins himself and began to investigate that he found what he was looking for. His grandfather had been dead for a long time; his grandmother had died recently. \u201cAt the funeral we met 50 new relatives, all at once,\u201d he recalls. \u00a0A short time later, Nobel bought a caravan and moved from one place to the next for 20 years. His father visited him, made his own friends, and at some point, also made peace with his Yenish identity, which he had previously seen mainly as a stigma.",
                    "Siegfried succeeded in preventing many marriages and determining the course his \u201cwards\u2019\u201d lives took. The care files about the \u201cchildren of the road\u201d were harshly defamatory. At the age of 14, Uschi Waser experienced first-hand what effects this could have. She filed a complaint against her stepfather, who had sexually abused and raped her for years. The court acquitted him, however, based on statements and file entries about Waser that portrayed her as untrustworthy. \u201cBasically, I didn't stand a chance from the start,\u201d she says.",
                    "During the trial, Waser tried to take her own life. \u201cI remember it as if it were today,\u201d she says. \u201cI wondered who would put a flower on my grave. And I reached the conclusion that no one would.\u201d Not her mother, who had sided with her husband in the trial. Nor the nuns who called her \u201cnaturally mendacious,\u201d nor the guardian who only showed up after she had slit her wrists. The suicide attempt was taken as an admission she was lying and Waser was sent to therapy - not as a victim, but because she was deemed \u201cpathological\u201d.",
                    "She still finds it hard to talk about that time. When she saw her files in 1989, at the age of 37, she finally understood just how unlucky she had been. \u201cI could never have imagined how cruel, how inhuman it was,\u201d she says.",
                    "The Pro Juventute guardianship files were a bone of contention between the people they concerned, the cantons and the government for years, until they were finally handed over to the Federal Archives in 1986. The victims could see the files for the first time. For many, it was a difficult part of their search for family and identity. Nobel, for example, talks about his father's feelings.\u00a0\u201cEven if you know the difference between facts and files, four federal files full of derogatory statements about you and your family don\u2019t leave anyone indifferent,\u201d he shares.",
                    "Without these files, Waser would be a different person today. But she would also never have gone public with her story. \u201cI had to, otherwise I would have suffocated on it, killed myself or ended up an alcoholic,\u201d she says. Now she is one of the few people affected who has told her story. Many others can't, or don't want to anymore.",
                    "As president of the Naschet Jenische Foundation (the name means \u201cRise Up, Yenish people!\u201d), Waser is strongly committed to publicly confronting the past, has worked on a wide variety of projects, and has given countless interviews. But even she has never spoken to her daughters in detail about her past. Instead, she has developed her own strategies to come to terms with it. She has gained the upper hand over the files that for so long determined her life and controlled every step she takes. And she always keeps a door open for herself. \u201cI always need an escape route, a \u2018via d'uscita,\u2019\u201d she says. Her \u201cvia d'uscita\u201d can mean a car of her own so that she can drive away at any time, or even just having enough cash on her to stay in a hotel.",
                    "What remains is her mistrust of authorities and the fear of having to go back into care. \u201cI signed up for Exit,\u00a0the assisted suicide organisation,\" Waser says. \u201cNow I just have to hope I don\u2019t miss the right moment to jump.\u201d",

                    "Establishing a new article in the Constitution could move things forward. \u201cOne solution would be to create federal recognition in addition to cantonal recognition,\u201d Brosi said. \u201cThis would allow other religions to participate, for example, in chaplaincy services in hospitals or prisons or in religious instruction in schools.\u201d",
                    "A new constitutional article would also highlight the importance of religion. \u201cMore than half of the population in Switzerland belongs to a religious community,\u201d said pastor Rita Famos, president of the PCS. \u201cIt\u2019s a force in society that should also be organised at a political level. I find it dangerous to say that [at the federal level] the state has nothing to do with religion.\u201d",
                    "The conference panellists also proposed the creation of a federal centre of expertise on religion. This could take a number of forms, such as an extra-parliamentary federal commission on religion or a federal office for religion. But one thing is certain, the speakers felt: a specialised centre, along the lines of what is being done in canton Zurich, would be beneficial.",
                    "\u201cThe federal administration needs a centre with expertise on religious matters,\u201d Famos said. \u201cLaws are constantly being passed that affect religious communities, but no one has the relevant expertise. We have to intervene once things are already done or decided, which is always a bit painful.\u201d",
                    "Brosi offered a specific example. \u201cIn January the government took initial steps to revise the federal law on asylum. The revision would permit federal financing of the chaplaincy services of religious communities that don\u2019t collect a religious tax. Yet the question of religious tax is not determined at the federal level for any religion \u2013 because it depends on the cantons. During the revision process it became clear that no one had considered this aspect of the problem.\u201d",
                    "The proposals that emerged from Polit-Forum Bern are, for the time being, only wishful thinking. No plans exist to establish a new constitutional article or to create a federal centre of expertise.",
                    "\u201cThere are many difficult and very emotional issues, such as recognition of Islam. I think this is one of the main reasons that we can\u2019t find a simple solution,\u201d Brosi said.",
                    "\u201cWe advance by responding to issues as they arise, without any fundamental debate about state interaction with religious communities. For example, a study showed that a chaplaincy service helps reduce the potential for violence in federal asylum centres. Because of a preconceived idea that the problem mainly affects Muslim refugees, an experimental Muslim chaplaincy was established. This is typical: a problem arises and we find a solution. It\u2019s admittedly very pragmatic, but the result is that there\u2019s now a solution for Muslims but not for the other religious communities in the asylum centres.\u201d",

                    "For Veri, the weekend\u2019s referendum result \u201ccomes as anything but a surprise\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m more surprised by the actions of the incumbent prime minister, Anthony Albanese, who must have known how difficult such referendums are in Australia,\u201d he tells SWI swissinfo.ch.",
                    "On Saturday almost 18 million Australians voted in a referendum on a constitutional amendment that would have established an indigenous consultative body to the Australian parliament. The bill was defeated by a clear margin of 60%, with all six states voting against it.",
                    "The proposal started with the so-called Uluru Declaration, a petition by indigenous groups in 2017 demanding more influence. At the time, the Liberal-Conservative government rejected it as too radical, but after a change of government, Labor Prime Minister Anthony Albanese put it on the agenda.",
                    "The political involvement of the indigenous peoples, who have inhabited the continent for more than 60,000 years, is historically burdened. Unlike neighbouring New Zealand, for example, Australia did not conclude a treaty with the Aboriginal population when it founded the modern federal state. After the arrival of the first white settlers in 1788, they remained without any rights for a long time and were recognised as citizens only in 1967.",
                    "Veri, who works for the Aarau Centre for Democracy and for the Centre for Deliberative Democracy and Global Governance at the University of Canberra, the Australian capital, sees reasons for the defeat at the ballot box in the democratic system.",
                    "The fathers of the constitution at the end of the 19th century drew inspiration from Switzerland. In Switzerland, as in Australia, a constitutional amendment requires a majority of the people and the cantons (in Australia \u201cstates\u201d).",
                    "But there are also considerable differences, with the result that the success rate of government bills in Australian referendums differs markedly from that in the direct-democratic model state of Switzerland. While one in five bills is passed in Australia, almost three-quarters clear this hurdle in Switzerland.",
                    "\u201cSince the Second World War no government in Australia has succeeded in passing a constitutional amendment against the will of the opposition in over 30 referendums,\u201d Veri says.",
                    "The current referendum confirms three fundamental deficits of Australian democracy, already evident in the failed referendum on the introduction of the republic in 1999. They concern the electoral system, federalism and compulsory voting.",
                    "\u201cIn the Australian parliament, which is elected by majority vote, it is almost impossible to find viable solutions that can stand up in a popular vote,\u201d Veri points out. In contrast, in Switzerland, the four largest parties in parliament (with close to 80% of the seats) are also represented in government, allowing the federal constitution to move with the times. Thus, in the last 175 years, the people and the cantons in Switzerland have been persuaded in 173 cases for amendments and on two occasions in 1874 and 1999 for a total revision.",
                    "Veri identifies a second hurdle for successful constitutional projects in Australian federalism, \u201cwhich has postcolonial features\u201d. Only six territories are recognised as full federal states. The part of the country with the largest proportion of indigenous people \u2013 the Northern Territory \u2013 is not counted as a state in a referendum. Neither is the Australia Capital Territory, with its capital Canberra, where on Saturday more than 60% voted in favour of a voice for indigenous people.\u00a0\u00a0",
                    "Veri sees the third major challenge in Australia\u2019s compulsory voting system. \u201cMany Australians see a referendum as an unnecessary burden rather than an opportunity to have a say. In addition, the compulsory vote does not contribute to better informed citizens, but to an advantage for the status quo, as poorly informed voters have to vote,\u201d he says.",
                    "In the run-up to the vote, this manifested itself in a campaign by opponents under the slogan \u201cIf you don\u2019t know, vote no\u201d. In addition, much misinformation circulated about a possible future veto role for indigenous people in Australian politics in the event of a yes vote.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
                    "According to Francesco Veri, the failed vote on October 14 \u201cis not only a defeat for Aboriginal people in Australia, but also a defeat for democracy in the country\u201d.",
                    "Any future referendum can have a chance of success only if it comes from a conservative government, he says. To this end, Veri recommends reforms of federalism and voting rights \u2013 again modelled on Switzerland.",

The study cited above predicts a drop in revenue of tens of millions of francs over the next 20 years. In addition to the decline in the number of taxpayers paying church tax (see box below), the study predicts that the churches will find it increasingly difficult to defend their legitimacy to collect public money if their influence in society continues to decline.",
                    "The funding of churches in Switzerland has two major differences from other systems. The first is that the relationship between the Church and the state (and therefore the funding of religious communities) is governed by the country\u2019s 26 cantons rather than the government.",
                    "There are as many variants as there are cantons, but most levy a church tax. This tax is paid by individuals, who must make an official request to leave the Church in order to avoid it, which means that they can no longer attend services.",
                    "In some cantons, legal entities, i.e. companies, are also required to pay church tax, which is a matter of debate. According to one study, the funding received by the two churches via this tax amounts to more than CHF1.3 billion ($1.45 billion).",

                    "However, the three-pillar system does not live up to its promise, as the pensions paid by the OASI are not sufficient to live on and many pensioners have to rely on supplementary state benefits. In addition, women and low-income earners are under-represented in the occupational pension provision and therefore generally receive a lower pension. While the finances of the old-age insurance system are particularly affected by the rise in life expectancy, the finances of the occupational pension provision are also affected by market turbulence: a poor economic climate can quickly lead to a decline in the investment performance of pension funds.",
                    "In order to reduce inequalities in retirement and to cope with the demographic changes in society, the Swiss authorities have initiated several reforms, as have many other countries. But Switzerland\u2019s direct democracy and the complexity of the system are slowing down the process. A revision of the OASI, which included an increase in the retirement age for women, was rejected by voters in 2004. A new project modifying the functioning of both the first and second pillars, still with the aim of pushing back women\u2019s retirement, was again swept aside at the ballot box in 2017.",

                    "This raises the question of what, exactly, neutrality means. When the allies granted Switzerland perpetual neutrality at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the deal was that Switzerland would not take part in conflicts and would not provide mercenaries; in return, no more wars would be fought on its territory.",
                    "This principle has changed little over time; even today, the law of neutrality primarily obliges states not to participate in wars, either directly or indirectly. Neutral states must treat parties at war equally, i.e., they may not allow overflights or supply weapons to one side - even via third parties - and neglect to help the other side.",
                    "In recent months, Switzerland has banned NATO members from overflying because they were supplying Ukraine with weapons. And it refused to grant Germany and Denmark permission to give Ukraine tanks and ammunition bought from Switzerland. Pressure on Switzerland to back down from this strict stance is increasing abroad.",
                    "Neutrality is not only a legal concept, but also affects Switzerland's image. Neutrality is an intrinsic part of Switzerland\u2019s identity, and it should not be jeopardized lightly.

It is much more likely that several European countries will be attacked at the same time and defend themselves together. If Switzerland participates in military exercises in peacetime and equips itself with compatible weapons systems, it will be in a position to fight alongside its Western friends in an emergency instead of having to defend itself alone. This is one of the reasons it has chosen US manufacturer Lockheed-Martin to manufacture its new F-35 fighter jet.",

Although Switzerland wants to increase defence spending dramatically, it is still far from NATO\u2019s target, which requires members to invest 2% of GDP in defence. Critics say Switzerland benefits from NATO's protective umbrella without bearing the burden of a member state.",
                    "In general, neutrality is of great benefit to Switzerland. It may sound paradoxical, but neutrality boosts arms sales. Some countries do not want to position themselves by buying weapons from the great powers such as the US or Russia, so prefer to turn to trusted neutral countries.",
                    "Switzerland also benefits from neutrality as a host location and mediator, because those who choose not to take a stance are more credible as bridge-builders.",

                    "\u201cUsually, research is limited to a specific period or event,\" says Dorthe. Having all the documented witch trials for such a long period is a first, and can serve as a point of comparison for other regions of the world.\u201d",
                    "The public often associates witch trials with the Middle Ages and the Inquisition. But this view is only partially correct.\u00a0",
                    "\u201cIt is generally thought that these persecutions date back to the Middle Ages and that it was the Church that dealt with them, when in fact it was a phenomenon of the Ancien R\u00e9gime,\" says Dorthe, referring to the political and social system of the Kingdom of France from the Late Middle Ages until 1789 and the French Revolution. \u201cThat's when most of the trials in Europe and even the United States took place. And they are almost exclusively conducted by secular courts.\"",
                    "\u201cThe phenomenon of persecution certainly appeared at the beginning of the 15th century, which was the last of the Middle Ages,\" he says. \u201cAt that time, treatises on demonology were being written and people began to believe that a satanic sect was forming that was hostile to Christian society. In fact, it was the Inquisition, mostly led by Dominicans, that began to hunt down people for witchcraft.\"\u00a0",
                    "The secular authorities were involved in the process from the outset, but they soon took matters into their own hands and were quick to prosecute people for crimes of witchcraft. The scale of the phenomenon varied. If one takes into account a few registers that have disappeared and include trials in the bailiwicks, it adds up to a total of a thousand trials in 250 years for the whole canton of Fribourg, an average of four a year, which does not constitute a mass phenomenon. In the ",
                    ", however, there were 3,000 trials over the same period.",
                    "\u201cNot all regions of Europe experienced the same intensity,\" says Dorthe. \u201cIn regions where power was insecure, such as the Pays de Vaud under Bernese rule, judges used their powers to combat witchcraft. It's typical: the less power you have, the more you use it. But in regions where power was stronger, such as Fribourg or France, there was no competition for judicial prerogatives and witchcraft trials were not used as political weapons.\u201d",
                    "The Fribourg archives show that an accusation of witchcraft could affect almost anyone.\u00a0",
                    "\u201cThere are, of course, people who fit the clich\u00e9: an elderly woman living alone who practises healing,\" says Dorthe. \u201cBut you can't pin down a typical profile; there are also men and even children. The social background is also diverse, with, for example, a squire who was a judge in a bailiwick and who was accused of witchcraft.\u201d",
                    "In such a context, specialists avoid the traditional term \"witch hunt\", because the phenomenon also concerned men in a third of cases. But also because the term \"hunt\" refers to voluntary and targeted action by the authorities.\u00a0",
                    "\u201cBut the phenomenon is more complex,\" notes the archivist. \u201cWithout the participation of the population, a relative or neighbour, and without the belief in the devil and magic, the edifice collapses.\"",
                    "\u00a0",
                    "\"Accusations of witchcraft are an outlet for explaining the misfortunes of the times or personal misfortunes,\" he continues. \u201cIt's an ideal way of getting rid of a neighbour you don't like or an intrusive mother-in-law. If a young child dies, we try to find the person responsible, especially if that person is a midwife or healer. If a farmer notices a sharp drop in the yield of his cows, he will also look for a scapegoat. In Fribourg, where there's a big dairy industry, neighbours are regularly accused of using magic formulas to 'draw the milk' from the cows and transfer it into the udders of their own animals.\"",
                    "The public often associates witch trials with scenes of torture and death at the stake. This view is not wrong, but while the justice of the time was harsh, it was not necessarily blind.",
                    "\u201cJudges used torture, but not systematically. Moreover, it was only a tool. Torture existed to help the course of justice,\" says Dorthe. \u201cWe must avoid any anachronism by basing our emotions and beliefs on those of the past. We must not regard judges as sadists. They have to do their job, and the laws of the time allowed them to use torture to loosen tongues.\"",
                    "Death was not necessarily the end of the road for those suspected. In 40% of cases, trials resulted in a sentence of exile (the convicted person had to leave the canton)\u00a0or internal banishment (they were confined to their parish and forbidden to leave). The death penalty was imposed in less than a third (30%) of trials.",
                    "For crimes of witchcraft, death was by burning at the stake. In half of the 80 executions recorded in Fribourg, the sentence was \"mitigated\", i.e. softened. To prevent the condemned person from dying by the action of the flames, he or she was first strangled. Sometimes, a small bag of gunpowder was placed around the neck so that it explodes before burning.",
                    "Today, persecution for the crime of witchcraft is presented as a phenomenon that affected\u00a0women exclusively. But this representation is not supported by the archives.",
                    "\u201cThe feminist figure of the witch does not correspond at all to the historical sources,\" points out Dorthe. \u201cThis idea that the witch was an independent woman who attracted the hatred of the patriarchy is false.\"",
                    "\u201cThis feminisation of the phenomenon has its origins in",
                    ", an essay by Jules Michelet,\" he adds. \u201cThis 19th-century French historian transformed the witch into an ideal or idealised victim, a figure of struggle against all authority. This image corresponds more to the very romantic aspirations of the 19th century than to historical fact. Many feminists took up this image of the emancipated or emancipating witch from the 1960s onwards.\"",
                    "But this appropriation doesn't bother\u00a0Dorthe too much.\u00a0",
                    "\"As scientists, we're going to find this process scandalous, because it doesn't correspond to reality. But in terms of the effectiveness of the discourse we want to have today, it's probably wiser to use a symbol than to make a big speech. We live in a society where emotion now takes precedence over reason, not least because of social networking. Using an almost familiar figure like the witch is therefore effective, even if this figure is very far removed from historical reality.\"",

                    "When election polls are published in Switzerland, people can talk for days about how one party has declined markedly while another has shot up. But, in fact, the changes are generally minimal. The most recent such survey, in March, suggested that the Greens had slipped by 2.5% compared to the previous elections in 2019, while the Swiss People\u2019s Party had advanced 1% \u2013 and all this with a margin of error of 1.2%.",

                    "Indeed, if there is one thing that sets the Swiss parliament apart, it is its extraordinary stability. This does not mean its make-up has remained the same over the past 175 years. Not at all. In the past 20 years the People\u2019s Party has made strong gains, almost tripling its electoral strength between 1991 and 2015. Two new forces have also appeared, the Green Party and the Liberal Green Party, which, compared with other more ephemeral formations in Swiss political history, seem to be here to stay.",
                    "But in contrast with other Western democracies, the shift of balances in Switzerland is more tectonic than volcanic, as shown by this graph summing up the strength of the different parties in the House of Representatives, which has been elected by proportional representation since 1919.",
                    "The Federal Assembly \u2013 as the Swiss parliament is officially called \u2013 comprises two chambers: the Senate, which represents the country\u2019s 26 cantons and has 46 members, and the House of Representatives, whose 200 members represent the people.",
                    "The two chambers meet separately for three-week sessions four times a year. They debate all constitutional amendments before putting them to the popular vote. They also adopt, amend or repeal federal legislation.",
                    "This bicameral system was established in 1848, after the birth of the federal state, and basically follows the US model. The two bodies have equal powers, and all decisions must be approved by both chambers.",
                    "The number of representatives in the Senate has not changed: two senators per canton, with the exception of ",
                    " which send one each. In other words, 44 members until 1978 and 46 since 1979, when canton Jura joined the Swiss Confederation as a full member.",
                    "The House of Representatives, meanwhile, has undergone several changes. In 1848 it had 111 members, each representing around 20,000 inhabitants, including foreigners. All the parliamentarians were male, as women weren\u2019t elected to parliament until 1971, after the introduction of voting rights for women. Population growth has led to a steady increase in the number of representatives. Since 1962 it has been fixed at 200. Today, each member of the House of Representatives represents about 40,000 inhabitants.",
                    "These members are apportioned to the cantons in proportion to their population. Thus, Zurich is entitled to 35 seats, while Appenzell Inner Rhodes and other small cantons have just one each. Cantons quite frequently gain or lose a seat as their population oscillates.",
                    "Elections to the Senate are held almost everywhere using the majoritarian system (winner takes all). Only cantons Neuch\u00e2tel and Jura \u2013 which often do things differently \u2013 apply the proportional system.",
                    "The House of Representatives, meanwhile, has been elected under the proportional system since 1919. The electoral constituencies are the cantons.",
                    "This coexistence of a majoritarian and a proportional system has a marked impact on the weight of the parties in parliament. In the House of Representatives, the percentage of votes obtained by each party determines their representation. Incidentally, this percentage is also generally used to analyse the outcome of an election and the progression or decline of a given political force.",
                    "By contrast, the majority system used for elections to the Senate does not necessarily favour the numerically strongest party at the national level. Other considerations prevail, for instance how deeply a party is rooted in the canton, its ability to create alliances and present a single candidate, and the candidate\u2019s own ability to build consensus. It is no coincidence that the Senate is still dominated by two historic parties, which between them, however, won just over 26% of the votes in the previous election. The Centre Party and the Radical-Liberal Party have, in fact, no fewer than 25 representatives (13 for the former, 12 for the latter) out of 46. Meanwhile, Switzerland\u2019s biggest party, the People\u2019s Party, with a vote share of 25.6%, won just six seats.",
                    "Unlike in other countries, such as the US, where the president can veto certain acts, the Swiss parliament is immune from the other two powers. Its decisions cannot be challenged by the government. Nor can their constitutionality be questioned by the Federal Court, Switzerland\u2019s highest judicial body.",
                    "On the other hand, motions of censure do not exist in Switzerland and the Federal Assembly cannot dismiss the government in this way. Nor can it remove a member of the country\u2019s seven-member executive body, the Federal Council, during their term of office, except in exceptional cases such as serious illness.",
                    "The only possibility parliament has to express its discontent with a member of the executive is during the election of the government, which takes place every four years, in the December following federal elections. However, the system of consensus democracy that characterises the Swiss political system makes this extremely rare. Since 1848, only four members of the government have not been re-elected by parliament. The last was the leader of the People\u2019s Party, Christoph Blocher, in 2007.",
                    "Nor is there any antagonism between the majority and the opposition in Switzerland. On most issues, the government and parliament must try to find a compromise supported by a majority, which may vary according to the matter at hand, as there is no coalition agreement between the political forces. Moreover, legislative members from the governing parties are not obliged to support the decisions of the government.",
                    "All this means that Switzerland does not experience government crises and early elections. The current parliamentary term is the 51st since 1848.\u00a0",
                    "Although its decisions are law, a heavy sword of Damocles hangs over parliament in the form of the optional referendum. By collecting 50,000 signatures within 100 days of the official publication of an act, anyone can oppose the decision of the legislature and request that a law or federal decree be submitted to the judgement of voters at the polls.",
                    "From the founding of the federal State in 1848 until the introduction of proportional representation in 1917, the Federal Assembly was dominated by the Radical Democratic Party (which became the Radical-Liberal Party in 2009), opposed only by the conservative Catholics (the future Christian Democratic Party).",
                    "The introduction of a proportional system for the election of the House of Representatives in 1919 was a complete game changer, enabling parties that had hitherto had to settle for crumbs to really weigh in on national politics. Thus, in that year, the Social Democratic Party grew from 22 to 41 representatives. In the same election, the Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents made a strong entry. It became the Swiss People\u2019s Party in 1971, and is today the largest party in the Swiss parliament.",

Since the turn of the millennium, however, with society\u2019s growing environmental awareness, first the Green Party and then the Liberal Green Party have reshuffled the cards \u2013 so much so that, in the last federal elections, between them they won a fifth of the seats in the Federal Assembly.",

                    "Employees from 15 different countries work at our offices in Bern. They all have international backgrounds and write about Switzerland day in, day out. Many of them have lived here for decades but have also kept up with current affairs in their home countries. Six of our journalists from Japan, the US, Tunisia, Russia, China and Mexico explain why Swiss elections are particularly interesting when compared to the political landscape of other countries.",
                    "Every four years the Swiss go to the polls to vote in federal elections. International media typically gives scant attention to this event as Switzerland is notoriously stable and political upheavals rare. But do Swiss elections deserve more attention? Our international journalists certainly think so.",
                    "\u201cThe instruments of direct democracy take away the power from parliamentarians because we know that the people have the final say. This is how power gets pulverised in Switzerland.\u201d",
                    "This was the response of a Swiss parliamentarian when, some time ago, two Mexican journalists and I asked how the political system worked in Switzerland. It is true that good election results are by no means a blind vote of confidence for the new government after parliamentary elections. The Swiss regularly use their right to veto against decisions taken by the legislature. Regular popular votes on initiatives and referenda give the Swiss the opportunity to express their opinions on decisions by the federal government or propose constitutional amendments.",
                    "I am from Mexico. More than 25 years ago, I asked a few Mexican media outlets whether I could work for them as a foreign correspondent in Switzerland. \u201cSwiss politics is boring,\u201d was the usual response to my inquiry.",
                    "It\u2019s all a matter of perspective. It is true that Swiss elections cannot be boiled down to a single power struggle between two or three political figures. But that\u2019s also what makes the Swiss system interesting to analyse. Compared to Mexico, the president in Switzerland has little clout. Once the Swiss people have cast their votes, parliament elects the federal government. It is a council of seven members who are affiliated with the strongest parties. This shows that consensus is very important in Switzerland, and political power is divided between several parties.",
                    "This could be the reason why not everyone in Switzerland knows the names of the members of government. Sometimes people don\u2019t even know who holds the presidential office as this post rotates once per year among the members and is mainly symbolic.",
                    "The rotating presidency is another important feature of the Swiss system of power-sharing that makes Switzerland so different from other countries like Mexico where politics is almost like a telenovela.",
                    "\u00a0",
                    "Switzerland is a small and modest country. People here believe that the democratic system of their confederation is so complicated that it would be too difficult to explain to foreigners. But there is something paradoxical about it. Despite being at the heart of Europe; the leading power in economic globalisation; the main player in the global financial and banking centre; the hub for the headquarters of many international organisations; and a country with a powerful military-industrial complex, Swiss federal elections never seem to attract much attention, and hardly anyone outside the country knows the names of the leading politicians.",
                    "Let\u2019s try to change that, and at the same time, try to explain why this is the case: the instruments of traditional representative democracy co-exist with the instruments of direct democracy. So, why is it that Swiss national elections do not bring much change? Because changes don\u2019t only happen in Switzerland every four years; they literally happen every day. That\u2019s because\u00a0 popular votes are regularly conducted at a national, cantonal and municipal level. Due to its direct democratic system, the election result of one party does not make a big difference in Switzerland.",
                    "It is more important how a party operates at all levels of the federal system \u2013 namely local, cantonal and national \u2013 on a daily basis during the time between elections. Thanks to regular popular votes and referenda, an election victory does not give the winning party carte blanche to do whatever it wants for the following four years. On the day after the elections, the parties are obliged to present the people with solutions to very specific problems. These are usually legislative proposals or initiatives which are then put to a referendum. So, it can happen that yesterday\u2019s winner suffers a great defeat on the issue in question.",
                    "The term \u201csilver democracy\u201d has long been around in Japan. Due to the ageing population and the low election turnout among young people, the \u201cpolitics of the elderly, made by the elderly and for the elderly\u201d dominate Japanese elections. This makes it easier for ageing politicians and their parties to win and implement their policies. As the high costs Japan spends on social welfare put a burden on public finances, reforms to cut public spending for elderly people have been postponed while young people face rising taxes and insurance premiums. Young people in Japan have no prospects, and the birth rate continues to be on a downward spiral. It is a vicious circle.",
                    "I am not worried that democracy in Switzerland will move in the same direction. In this year\u2019s election campaign, the left-wing Social Democrats demand to extend public childcare while the biggest party, the Swiss People\u2019s Party, is clearly against it. Polls on the most pressing issues have shown that \u201chealth insurance premiums\u201d, \u201cimmigration\u201d and \u201cpension reforms\u201d are on top of the list of concerns. \u201cFamily policy\u201d does not even get mentioned.",
                    "How come there is such a lack of interest in family policy? Is the low birthrate not an important issue for Switzerland? After all, it attracts immigrants looking for higher wages, a better standard of living and a more stable political and economic environment. And don\u2019t they think it is important to elect politicians to parliament who are interested in the needs of young people given that political issues are decided upon at the ballot box in Switzerland? These questions remain unanswered.",
                    "I have a hunch that Switzerland runs the risk of becoming a silver democracy. The percentage of elderly people in the Swiss population in 2022 was 19.2%. This was lower than the percentage in Japan, which was 29.1%. However, the share of foreigners aged 18 and older who are not eligible to vote stands at 26% in Switzerland. This means that the electorate is significantly older, and at 23.1% is almost as high as it was in Japan in 2010.",
                    "Will Switzerland manage to avoid becoming a silver democracy? If it does, it could be another prime example for all developed countries with an ageing society.",
                    "I still remember with much nostalgia when I first participated in parliamentary elections at the age of 22! These were not the first elections held in my country, Tunisia. But they were the first free, democratic, and transparent elections. So, I happily dipped my finger in blue voting ink and shared the photo on social media. It wasn't just a political exercise; it was a celebration! I felt the weight of history when I cast my ballot as I knew that I was contributing to a democratic process that embodied the hopes of generations before me as well as my own generation. Now that I live in Switzerland, I am eager to participate in the democratic process.",
                    "A quarter of the Swiss population, including me, is not allowed to vote in parliamentary elections. As Switzerland is approaching parliamentary elections in October 2023, the approximately ",
                    " who permanently live in the country will not receive invitations to participate in the electoral process. Only ",
                    " are eligible to vote at the federal level.",
                    "Some might argue: why would a foreigner like me be interested in Swiss federal elections? Apart from the obvious answer that I am a journalist who works in Switzerland, the answer to this question goes beyond the country\u2019s borders. The importance of these elections, and the ones to come, resonates with the families of immigrants \u2013 men and women \u2013 wherever they are. For families, the political orientations of Switzerland, the features of which are decided in the federal assembly, can shape the future or even determine the destinies of thousands of people, especially concerning immigration and international cooperation. This is the core of Switzerland\u2019s global importance. It is not only about internal politics but about the repercussions of those policies on people\u2019s lives outside.",
                    "Though I\u2019m currently not eligible to cast my vote, I remain vigilant and closely observe the upcoming elections in October 2023. Standing outside the democratic arena, I do what those who are side-lined often do: I nourish the dream that I will one day be allowed to join this democratic dance.",
                    "In Switzerland, parties have a completely different role than what is known in China.",
                    "In the preamble to the Chinese constitution, the \u201cCommunist Party of the People\u2019s Republic of China (CCP)\u201d is more prominent than \u201cGod the Almighty\u201d is in the preamble of the Swiss constitution. While article 1 of the Swiss constitution lists all 26 cantons that form the Swiss confederation, article 1 of the Chinese constitution makes clear that the socialist system is the fundamental system of the People\u2019s Republic of China and that the leadership by the Communist Party defines Chinese socialism.",
                    "The office of the General Secretary of the CCP has absolute power in China while the political power of the general secretaries and presidents of Swiss parties depends on how persuasive they are in the elections. The legal status of political parties in Switzerland is rather weak. It was only in 1999 that a small article (Art. 137) on the status of the political parties was added to the constitution, which says: \u201cThe political parties shall contribute to forming the opinion and the will of the people.\u201d However, we never talk about one party\u2019s relationship with the state in Switzerland because there are so many different parties. Eleven parties are represented in parliament, four of which are also represented in the government.",
                    "The party landscape in Switzerland is constantly changing. Parties come and go, some merge, others change their name, and some remain the same. All parties must repeatedly stand their ground when it comes to political concepts and the fight for their voters\u2019 share. They have to convince their voters by offering good solutions to the issues that concern the population. At the end, the voters decide, and sometimes they have no mercy when they are not happy with a party\u2019s performance.",
                    "The United States and Switzerland have a lot in common. They are both proud of their democracies and the enshrined right to vote. Increasingly, they have something else in common \u2013 growing polarisation.",

Today\u2019s polarisation in both countries is emotional and tied to a growing intolerance towards people with different points of view. While some of the issues that divide people may be different \u2013 for example, abortion is a much more divisive issue in the US than in Switzerland \u2013 in both places, I find people are increasingly quick to judge someone\u2019s character based on whether they are for or against an issue.",

                    "It can also make people disillusioned with politics altogether. When voters see politicians more focused on drawing dividing lines than on finding solutions, they are likely to look for answers elsewhere retreating to their \u201ccamps\u201d and perpetuating the cycle.",

                    "Swiss elections are not renowned for ushering in huge changes \u2013 you would have to look hard to find drama. And since the start of the Israeli-Palestinian war, public interest has decisively shifted towards the global crises.\u00a0Reporting on the 2023 elections may also have been stunted due to the lack of any one overarching campaign theme \u2013 which wasn\u2019t the case four years ago with environmental topics taking centre stage with the\u00a0\u201cGreen Wave\u201d.",

The platform finds answer to questions such as, how\u00a0often did each party appear in the press? Which issue dominated? This year, 4,106 articles analysed during eight weeks threw up a range of issues: while \u201chealth insurance premiums and health\u201d might have been the most common, other themes like banks, traffic, energy, migration, and climate were all present, write the researchers Anja Heidelberger and Marc B\u00fchlmann.",

This year however, media coverage of the campaign was not based around \u201ca single predominant issue\u201d, the analysis says.",

Marc B\u00fchlmann, one of the co-authors of the study and the director of Ann\u00e9e Politique Suisse, tells SWI swissinfo.ch that \u201cin Switzerland, with its low participation rate, the central question of a campaign is which party manages to mobilise its pre-existing base. Four years ago, when the Greens were seen by the climate movement as a solution, the party\u2019s base was more strongly mobilised.\u201d",
                    "This time the party was less successful in turning the \u2013 still present \u2013 climate issue to its benefit. When media reports on climate are connected with activist who glue themselves to streets to block traffic \u2013 this doesn\u2019t help the Green Party.",
                    "The Ann\u00e9e Politique Suisse researchers also analyse how often parties appear in the media. On this score, the right-wing People\u2019s Party \u2013 the strongest in the country \u2013 is most often mentioned, followed by the left-wing Social Democrats, the centre-right Radical-Liberals, and the centrist Centre Party.",
                    "The frequency of media coverage corresponds strikingly similarly to the share of votes won by the parties in the 2019 elections. However, the four main parties \u2013 with a seat in government \u2013 parties are over-represented in proportion to smaller parties; the most under-represented are the small opposition groups the Protestant Party, the Federal Democratic Union, the Geneva Citizens\u2019 Movement, and the Lega dei Ticinesi. \u201cTheir [combined] voter share of 10.1% corresponds to a media coverage share of 3.4%,\u201d the analysis states.",
                    "B\u00fchlmann says it\u2019s remarkable that the media mentions correspond so well to the 2019 election results. \u201cIt\u2019s still surprising how good the print media manages to portray the prevailing situation with regard to electoral strength,\u201d he says.",
                    "Political parties also campaign on social media, but B\u00fchlmann says it is more negligible. \u201cA large amount of voters are middle-aged people \u2013 they do not use social media as a source of information,\u201d he says. Parties might use social media as channels to mobilise their voter base, but \u201cat the moment it\u2019s probably quite hard to use them to sell yourself and win over new voters\u201d.",
                    "The \u201cPolitransparency\u201d platform shows that of all the Swiss parties, the Social Democrats invested most in Facebook and Instagram advertising: CHF429,100 ($480,500). The Radical-Liberals, the Liberal Greens, and the Greens were next, while the People\u2019s Party only invested CHF112,000 in social media advertising.",
                    "That said, a video by the People\u2019s Party which went viral on Instagram was viewed by well over 300,000 people \u2013 more than any other video published by a party account on that social media\u00a0platform.",

                    "Environmental politics has lost its appeal, in Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe. The defeat of the Greens and the Liberal Green Party echoes the difficulties experienced by green parties within the European Union. According to polls, they are also likely to suffer a setback in the European elections in June 2024.",
                    "During the 2019 election campaign, green themes had dominated public debate and provoked great mobilisation on the left of the political spectrum, notably with the organisation of climate strikes. This wasn\u2019t the case this year.",
                    "The trend seems paradoxical at a time when extreme weather events are multiplying and climate disruption remains one of Switzerland\u2019s main concerns. However, the fact that it's hot in October is not the primary concern of the population, a growing number of whom are struggling to make ends meet. And the urgency of climate change may also be creating a sense of powerlessness among the electorate.",
                    "In the end, environmental groups failed to make climate change \u201csexy\u201d. On the contrary, they have suffered from the hard-hitting actions of radical climate activists, who provoked confusion and even anger among a large part of the population.",
                    "The images of the Italian island of Lampedusa, confronted with a huge influx of migrants from North Africa, went around the world and brought asylum policy back to the forefront during this election year. This has been a boon for the right-wing Swiss People\u2019s Party, which has focused its campaign on its favourite theme, the fight against immigration.",
                    "With the rise in asylum applications (12,188 between the beginning of January and the end of June, or +43% compared to 2022), in addition to the presence of 65,000 refugees from Ukraine, the Swiss People\u2019s Party was able to capitalise on the growing concerns of part of the population.",

                    " from the Federal Commission against Racism. Nonetheless, this very clear discourse had a mobilising effect on the party's base at a time of international insecurity.",
                    "The People\u2019s Party also found an ideal scapegoat in the new Justice Minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, a Social Democrat. This winning tactic, already tried and tested several times in the past, enabled the party to erase its 2019 defeat and come close again this Sunday to its 2015 record level.",
                    "Under the slogan \u201cfirm but fair\u201d, the Radical-Liberal Party also made immigration policy one of its priority themes during the election campaign. In contrast to the People\u2019s Party, the Radical-Liberals insisted on the need to maintain the free movement of people to attract skilled European workers, while hammering home its desire to combat \u201csocial tourism\u201d and \u201casylum chaos\u201d.",
                    "With this stance and its surprisingly virulent attacks on Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, the Radical-Liberals did not want to leave the field open to the isolationist right on this issue. The fact remains, however, that voters clearly gave more credence to the solutions proposed by the People\u2019s Party.",
                    "At a time of full employment, the Radical-Liberals also lacked another strong mobilising theme. As for the mismanagement of Credit Suisse, taken over by its rival UBS, this certainly helped to damage the image of the Radical-Liberals, historically closely linked to the Swiss financial centre.",
                    "As a result, the founding party of modern Switzerland stagnated in these elections and failed to reverse its long-term decline. Whereas in the early 1980s the Radical-Liberals attracted almost a quarter of the electorate, today it convinced just over one in seven voters.",
                    "For its 2023 election campaign, the Socialist Party went back to basics: the fight for household purchasing power. The return of inflation and the announcement of a substantial rise in health insurance premiums just one month before the federal elections put social issues back at the heart of the stakes. The Social Democrats were thus able to win back a few votes from the Greens in the left-wing camp.",
                    "But while health insurance premiums are once again the number-one concern of the Swiss, ahead of immigration, the Social Democrats ultimately profited only marginally from the discontent rumbling among some middle-class voters.\u00a0",
                    "Unlike the People\u2019s Party, on the issue of immigration and the Greens on that of global warming, the Social Democratic Party is not necessarily considered the most competent political force in the complex field of health insurance.",
                    "In a country that relies heavily on individual freedom, the proposals coming out of the Social Democratic Party for a single health insurance scheme and income-based premiums are seen as excessive nationalisation by the majority of voters. The Social Democrats may have a loyal following on the left, but it is still struggling to recruit beyond its traditional territories.",
                    "Even if isn\u2019t a major upset, this is a historic moment in Swiss politics: the Centre is neck-and-neck with the Radical-Liberals as the country's third political force. Depending on the final results in both chambers, it would be mathematically entitled to a second seat on the Federal Council. This is in accordance with the \u201c",
                    "\u201d employed since 1959, whereby the three largest parties each hold two seats in the Swiss government, and the fourth holds one seat.",
                    "Does this mean that Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis, from the Radical-Liberal Party, who ranks lowest in the popularity rankings of federal government ministers, has to fear for his time in office? Not at all, since it is also a principle that sitting members of the Federal Council may not be removed from office; this unwritten rule has only been broken three times in the last 175 years.",
                    "The Christian Democratic Party, of which the Centre\u00a0is an offshoot, took advantage of this four years ago, when the Greens narrowly overtook it in terms of votes. In 2021, the Christian Democratic Party merged with the Conservative Democratic Party under the new name of the Centre and has put its house in order.",
                    "One thing is certain: in the current constellation, the Centre will be even more enterprising and establish itself as the undisputed political force at the centre of the political spectrum. Under the leadership of party president Gerhard Pfister, it has shed its proverbial low profile. In the House of Representatives, it remains an important coalition partner for the Radical-Liberals and the People's Party, which between them don't have a majority. In the Senate, it should remain the most\u00a0important force.",
                    "Switzerland, a model democracy, is tired of politics. This is how we might analyse the turnout at these elections. At almost 47%, voter turnout is admittedly slightly higher than in 2019 (45%). But as has always been the case in recent decades, more than half the electorate failed to turn out at the polls. And this at a time when the world is going through one crisis after another and purchasing power is declining in Switzerland.",

                    "The electoral campaign was a far cry from the political flashpoints and intense fighting seen abroad. The parties rolled out their campaign slogans based on their preferred subjects, without encroaching too much on their opponents\u2019 turf. Nor were there any real in-depth debates on the major political issues of the day. The fall of Credit Suisse and relations with the European Union were absent from the campaign.",
                    "However, this is not an exception, but rather the rule in peaceful Switzerland. With the exception of lively debates on immigration in 2015 and the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011, campaigns are often bland. This is an inherent feature of Swiss direct democracy: with federal referendums taking place four times a year, the parties have plenty of other opportunities to explain their positions on various issues.",
                    "Nevertheless, as is the case every four years, this election campaign enabled the parties to forge links with the public. Each candidate had to give his or her all and shake hundreds, if not thousands, of hands in the hope of retaining or winning a seat in Bern. A rare and precious moment, even in a Swiss democracy often held up as a model of proximity between the people and their representatives.",

As a result, parties are increasingly vying for the votes of the Swiss Abroad. The People\u2019s Party, the Social Democrats, the Radical-Liberals and the Centre have been active in the diaspora and have international sections. In the past, these have helped some candidates secure the votes they needed to be elected.",

                    "What was still frowned upon in her own parental home, switching between Italian and German, the mother of two now consciously uses as a tool in everyday life: \u201cwhen I have to push my children in the morning, I switch to Swiss German. Then I\u2019m less strict with them than in Italian.\u201d",
                    "\u201cVery many multilingual people perceive a language and personality switch,\u201d says Jean-Marc Dewaele, professor of applied linguistics at Birkbeck University in London.",
                    "Originally raised in Belgium, he knows the phenomenon from his own experience: \u201cI read and write poetry almost exclusively in French. In the family we speak a lot of Dutch. But as an academic, I\u2019m British: in my choice of words as well as in my attitude and habitus.\u201d",
                    "In numerous studies with a total of 1,500 participants, Dewaele's thesis was confirmed: 80% of the multilingual people studied said that they behaved differently depending on the language. According to Dewaele, the \"emotional resonance\" of languages works in the background.",
                    "A well-known thought experiment from moral psychology makes the emotional resonance of languages tangible. Five people are lying tied up on a track. A train is heading towards them without braking. Only you have the possibility to stop the train by pushing a very strong person off a bridge onto the track. \u201cWould you do that? ",
                    "?\u201d",
                    "Depending on the language in which the moral dilemma is presented to you, you might come to a different conclusion. This is the result of a study published in 2014 by the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona.",
                    "In their mother tongue, 80% of the respondents still decided against pushing the man off the bridge. In English, the second language of the participants, the ratio changed: three times more respondents said they would do it and decided according to the principle of utility, i.e. more utilitarian.",
                    "The study leaders concluded that psychological distance and pragmatism are greater in the second language than in the first language. \u201cThe participants reacted more emotionally in their first language and more rationally in their second language,\u201d adds Dewaele, who is familiar with the study.",
                    "Depending on the context in which one has learned a language, more or less emotion is associated with it, he says: \u201cWe learn the mother tongue or first language in a family context, which is very emotional. When we learn a language in a classroom, the linguistic access to the emotional world is often completely missing. With the first language, the emotional resonance is very big, in the second case it is small.\u201d",
                    "Like author and yoga teacher Elisa Malinverni, multilingual people can actively use the switch. For example, it can be helpful to think about financial issues in a more rational second language.",
                    "Language switching is also a useful tool in psychotherapy, says Dewaele. \u201cPatients may be able to describe trauma more easily in a more rational second language. At a later stage, these can be expressed in the first language, even if the therapist does not understand the language.\u201d",
                    "Languages, with their emotional resonance, can thus resonate with speakers in different ways, like instruments. \u201cI think there is something wonderful about experiencing yourself differently in different languages,\u201d Malinverni sums up. \u201cYou have your own language for almost every facet of your own personality.\u201d",
                    "Linguist Dewaele adds: what was a second or foreign language can also become a new language of the heart.",
                    "In compliance with the JTI standards",

La Constitution polonaise interdit en principe de modifier les lois \u00e9lectorales dans les six mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant les \u00e9lections.

                    "Elles visent toutes \u00e0 renforcer les chances du gouvernement au d\u00e9triment des partis d\u2019opposition.

                    "C\u2019est surtout dans la population urbaine polonaise que la ligne du gouvernement rencontre une r\u00e9sistance croissante: d\u00e9but octobre, plus d\u2019un million de personnes ont manifest\u00e9 contre ces agissements dans tout le pays.",

                    "En 1997, les Polonais ont opt\u00e9 pour la Constitution actuelle. Depuis lors, ils ont pu se prononcer \u00e0 quatre reprises sur un projet de loi. Seule la question de l\u2019adh\u00e9sion \u00e0 l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne, en 2003, a suscit\u00e9 une participation sup\u00e9rieure aux 50% requis pour une d\u00e9cision valable: avec une participation de 59%, 78% des \u00e9lecteurs se sont prononc\u00e9s en faveur de l\u2019adh\u00e9sion. Douze ans plus tard, le pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019\u00e9poque Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski a soumis au vote, pour des raisons tactiques, trois questions \u00e0 motivation politique (sur le financement des partis, le scrutin majoritaire et une amnistie fiscale). La man\u0153uvre a \u00e9chou\u00e9 lamentablement: moins de huit pour cent des votants ont particip\u00e9 au scrutin.

Selon le Mouvement europ\u00e9en suisse, ce d\u00e9sint\u00e9r\u00eat a plusieurs explications. Un manque de courage et de vision politique, notamment de la part d\u2019une gauche que le Mouvement juge trop timor\u00e9e.

Mais un nouvel accord-cadre avec Bruxelles obligerait la Suisse \u00e0 suivre les mesures \u00e9dict\u00e9es par l\u2019UE. Laquelle pourrait par la m\u00eame occasion se d\u00e9barrasser de l\u2019\u00e9cheveau de r\u00e8glements sp\u00e9ciaux conclus depuis le temps avec la Suisse, dont certains qui rendent envieux des \u00c9tats-membres. \u00a0",

Et m\u00eame si la guerre en Ukraine a rappel\u00e9 que Berne et Bruxelles faisaient partie du m\u00eame continent, l\u2019UE doit solutionner des dossiers autrement plus cruciaux que la Suisse, toujours per\u00e7ue dans l\u2019Union comme un pays pique-assiette. \u00c0 Bruxelles, une participante au voyage conc\u00e8de que \u00absa position devient plus difficile\u00bb.

Elle a commis les crimes les plus graves en mati\u00e8re de droits humains. Les acteurs serbes ont syst\u00e9matiquement assassin\u00e9, utilis\u00e9 la violence sexuelle, et d\u00e9truit 40'000 maisons et une grande partie du patrimoine culturel.",
                    "Un gouvernement qui agit ainsi contre sa propre population perd le droit de r\u00e9gner sur elle. Les Albanais du Kosovo avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 leur ind\u00e9pendance en 1991. L\u2019intervention internationale de l\u2019OTAN a eu lieu en 1999, dans le but de garantir les droits humains fondamentaux et d\u2019emp\u00eacher une expulsion massive.",
                    "La situation dans les territoires aujourd\u2019hui occup\u00e9s de facto par la Russie est diff\u00e9rente. Nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019anciennes r\u00e9publiques sovi\u00e9tiques dont les fronti\u00e8res ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trac\u00e9es sciemment par Staline. Ce dernier a veill\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que des r\u00e9publiques telles que la G\u00e9orgie ou la Moldavie comprennent des minorit\u00e9s dans certaines zones. Ainsi, en cas de s\u00e9paration de l\u2019Union sovi\u00e9tique, ces r\u00e9gions d\u00e9stabiliseraient les jeunes \u00c9tats. C\u2019est exactement ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9. Contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019OTAN, Poutine n\u2019a pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9 les droits des minorit\u00e9s, mais a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment cr\u00e9\u00e9 des conflits.",
                    "Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance en 2008, le Kosovo n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un \u00c9tat souverain. Avant 1945, il ne s\u2019agissait m\u00eame pas d\u2019une entit\u00e9 territoriale. Le terme \u00abKosovo\u00bb se rapporte plut\u00f4t \u00e0 un paysage. Au d\u00e9part, il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019identit\u00e9 r\u00e9gionale, seulement la perception d\u2019une r\u00e9gion avec, de surcro\u00eet, des fronti\u00e8res vagues.",
                    "Les Serbes et les Albanais d\u00e9fendent des histoires qui se ressemblent par le fait qu\u2019elles excluent l\u2019autre. Pendant longtemps, l\u2019Occident ne concevait que la version serbe, que l\u2019on pourrait r\u00e9sumer ainsi: les Slaves ont atteint le Kosovo au d\u00e9but du Moyen-\u00c2ge. Les Serbes ont ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 vaincus en 1389 en d\u00e9fendant les Balkans contre les Ottomans. C\u2019est ainsi qu\u2019est n\u00e9 le mythe de la bataille du Kosovo, au cours de laquelle le prince serbe Lazar est tomb\u00e9 pour le christianisme et la nation serbe.",
                    "Ce mythe a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00c9tat serbe \u00e0 la fin du 19e si\u00e8cle pour justifier sa revendication sur cette r\u00e9gion. Selon l\u2019opinion serbe, la catastrophe au Kosovo commence par l\u2019immigration des Albanais. Ceux-ci ne seraient arriv\u00e9s qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin du 17e si\u00e8cle, profitant en quelque sorte de la domination ottomane. Or, la recherche historique montre que les Albanais sont l\u2019un des plus anciens groupes linguistiques d\u2019Europe et qu\u2019ils vivaient au Kosovo bien avant l\u2019arriv\u00e9e des Slaves. La version serbe anhistorique affirme exactement le contraire. Dans les ann\u00e9es\u00a01980, l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie serbe des sciences a m\u00eame avanc\u00e9 la th\u00e8se selon laquelle les Albanais commettaient un \u00abg\u00e9nocide biologique\u00bb contre les Serbes en raison de leur taux de natalit\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9.",
                    "Qui sont les Serbes du Kosovo? Ils se divisent essentiellement en deux groupes: premi\u00e8rement, ceux qui habitent dans des logements dispers\u00e9s dans le pays. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une population vieillissante qui ne pose pas de probl\u00e8me majeur. Beaucoup de jeunes, qu\u2019ils soient serbes ou albanais, quittent le Kosovo par manque de perspectives.",
                    "Deuxi\u00e8mement, un groupe plus cons\u00e9quent vit de mani\u00e8re compacte dans le nord du Kosovo, formant une sorte d\u2019\u00c9tat dans l\u2019\u00c9tat, financ\u00e9 par Belgrade. Cette configuration offre certains avantages mat\u00e9riels: par exemple, les personnes retrait\u00e9es re\u00e7oivent deux pensions, l\u2019une du Kosovo, l\u2019autre de la Serbie. Le nord du Kosovo est en outre un important centre de transit pour le crime organis\u00e9. Concr\u00e8tement, il n\u2019y a pas de police dans la r\u00e9gion. Les organisations mafieuses ont tout int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 tenir les forces de l\u2019ordre kosovares \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart. Dans ce contexte, chaque action de la police est qualifi\u00e9e de pr\u00e9tendue violence ethnique. Cet affrontement meurtrier a montr\u00e9 au monde entier \u00e0 quel point le crime organis\u00e9 est \u00e9troitement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la violence politique. Il illustre \u00e9galement les relations que ces r\u00e9seaux criminels entretiennent avec le gouvernement de Belgrade.",
                    "Le sujet est charg\u00e9. La Constitution serbe accorde une grande importance au Kosovo \u2014 un \u00c9tat ind\u00e9pendant \u2014 et toutes les institutions \u00e9tatiques ont pour objectif de reprendre le contr\u00f4le de ce territoire. Le nationalisme et le mythe serbes entravent la Serbie dans son d\u00e9veloppement vers l\u2019\u00c9tat de droit et la d\u00e9mocratie. En fait, ce pays en est encore tr\u00e8s loin.",
                    "Au d\u00e9but, on pensait que le Kosovo profiterait de ce changement g\u00e9opolitique, car la relation entre l\u2019Ukraine et la Russie ressemble en plusieurs points \u00e0 celle qu\u2019il entretient avec la Serbie: Russie et Serbie ne contestent pas seulement la nature \u00e9tatique de l\u2019autre, mais aussi son existence en tant que peuple. On veut dissoudre l\u2019autre, l\u2019int\u00e9grer dans son propre groupe ou l\u2019expulser. Il existe \u00e9galement des th\u00e9ories serbes selon lesquelles les Albanais seraient en fait des Serbes convertis \u00e0 l\u2019islam.",
                    "Mais jusqu\u2019aux violences perp\u00e9tr\u00e9es par les extr\u00e9mistes serbes en septembre 2023, c\u2019\u00e9tait plut\u00f4t le gouvernement kosovar qui \u00e9tait isol\u00e9. En effet, l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif serbe entretient de bonnes relations avec les \u00c9tats-Unis gr\u00e2ce aux livraisons de munitions de guerre \u00e0 l\u2019Ukraine. Or Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, qui penche aussi id\u00e9ologiquement vers la Russie, n\u2019est pas un d\u00e9mocrate, mais un dirigeant autoritaire qui agit brutalement \u00e0 l\u2019interne. Le fait que l\u2019Occident lui fasse la cour est dangereux, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le Kosovo est la seule d\u00e9mocratie qui fonctionne dans la r\u00e9gion.",
                    "Concernant l\u2019Ukraine, on parle, \u00e0 juste titre, de la d\u00e9fense des valeurs occidentales telles que la d\u00e9mocratie. En ce qui concerne les Balkans, l\u2019Occident (\u00c9tats-Unis en t\u00eate) porte atteinte au Kosovo en prenant position en faveur d\u2019Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, puisque ces m\u00eames valeurs y sont davantage respect\u00e9es qu\u2019en Serbie, et ceci gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019engagement massif des \u00c9tats occidentaux.",
                    "Le Kosovo a aujourd\u2019hui un paysage de partis politiques vivant. Parall\u00e8lement, des pays comme la Serbie et l\u2019Albanie ont pris du retard dans le d\u00e9veloppement de la d\u00e9mocratie. Les \u00e9lections qui s\u2019y d\u00e9roulent ne sont pas libres, ou alors l\u2019opposition n\u2019accepte pas les r\u00e9sultats et bloque, du moins temporairement, le parlement.",
                    "Certes, il y a encore beaucoup de choses qui ne vont pas au Kosovo, comme la corruption g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e des services de l\u2019\u00c9tat. Il faut toutefois garder en t\u00eate la situation de d\u00e9part: une population traumatis\u00e9e par l\u2019oppression, la guerre et l\u2019expulsion, un pays largement d\u00e9vast\u00e9 \u00e0 tous points de vue. Mais le test de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 pour toute d\u00e9mocratie est qu\u2019un gouvernement d\u00e9chu accepte sa d\u00e9faite. M\u00eame si les d\u00e9bats sur le gouvernement d\u2019Albin Kurti sont houleux, les changements de gouvernement sont possibles gr\u00e2ce aux \u00e9lections. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019est pas prisonni\u00e8re d\u2019un esprit autoritaire comme on le voit encore beaucoup en Serbie ou en Albanie.",
                    "La reconnaissance \u00e9tait maladroite, car elle \u00e9tait spontan\u00e9e et ne s\u2019inscrivait dans aucune strat\u00e9gie. Aujourd\u2019hui, la diplomatie suisse sur place est assez timide par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019importance de la Suisse au Kosovo et de la diaspora kosovare en Suisse \u2014 elle est moins visible que la diplomatie autrichienne. Les politiciens helv\u00e9tiques, par exemple, ne sont gu\u00e8re pr\u00e9sents sur le terrain.

Ce qui lui permet de s'exprimer pour remettre non seulement en cause des d\u00e9cisions parlementaires, mais pour proposer aussi des modifications dans la Constitution f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.",

                    "C\u2019est surtout une question de mise en perspective. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les \u00e9lections en Suisse ne se limitent pas \u00e0 une lutte entre deux ou trois protagonistes, c\u2019est justement l\u2019une des raisons qui rend ce syst\u00e8me int\u00e9ressant \u00e0 l\u2019analyse. Un syst\u00e8me aussi o\u00f9 le ou la pr\u00e9sident-e de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration rev\u00eat peu d'importance contrairement au Mexique.",
                    "Au lendemain des \u00e9lections du 22 octobre, le Parlement suisse \u00e9lira le gouvernement, soit un coll\u00e8ge form\u00e9 de sept membres issus des partis les plus dominants.

                    "Cette forme de pouvoir partag\u00e9 apporte donc la preuve qu\u2019un autre syst\u00e8me est possible. Autre en tout cas que celui au Mexique, o\u00f9 la politique ressemble toujours plus \u00e0 une ",

                    "En Suisse, petit pays empreint de modestie, l\u2019id\u00e9e pr\u00e9valente est que la d\u00e9mocratie qui y est pratiqu\u00e9e est un processus si compliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il est pratiquement vain de l\u2019expliquer \u00e0 des personnes \u00e9trang\u00e8res. Ce qui est paradoxal sachant que la Suisse est situ\u00e9e au c\u0153ur de l\u2019Europe, leader sur le front de la mondialisation, avec un r\u00f4le financier et bancaire de premier plan et o\u00f9 un nombre important d\u2019organisations internationales ont install\u00e9 leur si\u00e8ge. Un pays qui h\u00e9berge aussi un fort complexe militaro-industriel.",
                    "Pourtant, tous les quatre ans, les \u00e9lections l\u00e9gislatives qui s\u2019y d\u00e9roulent suscitent quasi de l\u2019indiff\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 les noms des politiciennes et politiciens suisses ne disent rien \u00e0 personne.",
                    "Essayons pourtant d\u2019expliquer en quoi des outils traditionnels (\u00e9lections) propres \u00e0 toute d\u00e9mocratie de type repr\u00e9sentative coexistent ici avec des outils de la d\u00e9mocratie directe. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, le discours entendu est de dire que ces \u00e9lections n\u2019apportent gu\u00e8re de changements.",
                    "Les choses \u00e0 mon avis ne changent en effet pas tous les quatre ans en Suisse, mais bel et bien tous les jours en raison des votations qui s\u2019y d\u00e9roulent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement \u00e0 tous les \u00e9chelons, f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, cantonal ou communal. J\u2019en ai donc conclu qu\u2019au pays de la d\u00e9mocratie directe, ce n'est pas le r\u00e9sultat \u00e0 des \u00e9lections qui est d\u00e9terminant pour l\u2019\u00e9lectorat.",
                    "C'est davantage sur la mani\u00e8re dont les partis \u0153uvrent toute l\u2019ann\u00e9e dans l\u2019imbroglio du syst\u00e8me f\u00e9d\u00e9raliste qu\u2019ils sont jug\u00e9s lors de ces \u00e9lections. Que leurs actions portent au niveau communal, cantonal ou f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Avec le droit d'initiative populaire et le r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum, une victoire aux \u00e9lections n\u2019offre en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 aucune garantie d\u2019avoir carte blanche durant quatre ans.",
                    "Apr\u00e8s ce scrutin, les partis politiques les plus en vue seront tenus d\u2019esquisser des solutions au travers de lois et d\u2019initiatives pour r\u00e9pondre aux d\u00e9fis contemporains. Mais ces textes pourraient \u00eatre aussi combattus par r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum. En conclusion, cela signifie que le parti vainqueur d\u2019une \u00e9lection peut subir une d\u00e9faite cuisante \u00e0 tout moment.",
                    "L'expression de \u00abd\u00e9mocratie vieillissante\u00bb a fait flor\u00e8s au Japon, confront\u00e9 depuis belle lurette au vieillissement de sa population ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 un faible taux de participation des jeunes aux \u00e9lections. \u00abUne politique des seniors faite par les seniors pour les seniors\u00bb s\u2019est instaur\u00e9e. Ce qui permet \u00e0 des parlementaires \u00e2g\u00e9s et aux partis traditionnels de glaner la mise r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement afin de mettre en \u0153uvre leur politique.",
                    "Les r\u00e9formes pour r\u00e9duire les d\u00e9penses pour les seniors sont report\u00e9es. Mais parall\u00e8lement, imp\u00f4ts et primes d'assurance augmentent pour les jeunes g\u00e9n\u00e9rations qui n\u2019ont plus aucune perspective d'avenir. Ceci alors que le taux de natalit\u00e9 continue de baisser. Ce cercle est vicieux.",
                    "La d\u00e9mocratie en Suisse est pour sa part encore pr\u00e9serv\u00e9e de ce genre de d\u00e9rive. Lors de cette campagne \u00e9lectorale, le parti socialiste (gauche) veut certes d\u00e9velopper les structures d\u2019accueil publiques pour la garde des enfants tandis que le parti le plus fort en termes d\u2019\u00e9lus \u00e0 Berne, l'Union d\u00e9mocratique du centre (UDC), d\u2019ob\u00e9dience conservatrice, s'y oppose.",
                    "Mais g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, la question de la politique familiale ne figure pas parmi les pr\u00e9occupations de l\u2019\u00e9lectorat. D\u2019apr\u00e8s des sondages, la hausse des primes des caisses-maladie, l\u2019immigration et la r\u00e9forme des retraites sont autrement plus pl\u00e9biscit\u00e9es par la population. \u00a0\u00a0",
                    "Qu\u2019est-ce qui expliquerait alors ce faible int\u00e9r\u00eat pour la politique familiale en Suisse? Le taux de natalit\u00e9 en berne n'est-il pas pris en compte alors que le pays suscite la convoitise de personnes migrantes qui r\u00eavent de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de meilleurs salaires, d\u2019une meilleure qualit\u00e9 de vie et d\u2019un climat politique et \u00e9conomique apais\u00e9? N\u2019est-il pas important d'envoyer au parlement des \u00e9lus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9coute des jeunes, a fortiori dans un pays o\u00f9 la plupart des objets finissent en vote? Autant de questions ouvertes.",
                    "Dans ces conditions, j\u2019ai le sentiment que la Suisse court le risque de devenir \u00e0 terme \u00e9galement un peu comme le Japon\u2026 \u00abune d\u00e9mocratie vieillissante\u00bb. Certes, d\u00e9mographiquement, selon les statistiques de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2022, la part des seniors est moins importante dans la population suisse (19,2%) qu\u2019elle l\u2019est au Japon, o\u00f9 le taux est de 29,1%.",
                    "Mais il convient cependant de relever que 26% des adultes de plus de 18 ans domicili\u00e9s en Suisse sont des personnes \u00e9trang\u00e8res qui n\u2019ont tout simplement pas le droit de voter. En d\u2019autres termes, le vieillissement de l'\u00e9lectorat suisse est plus net qu\u2019il n\u2019y para\u00eet de prime abord, s'\u00e9levant en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 \u00e0 23,1%. Soit le taux du Japon en 2010!",
                    "Je pose donc la question: la Suisse pourra-t-elle \u00e9viter de sombrer dans une d\u00e9mocratie de ce type? Ou deviendra-t-elle un mod\u00e8le pour des pays occidentaux \u00e0 la population de plus en plus vieillissante?",
                    "C\u2019est avec nostalgie que je repense aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 ma premi\u00e8re participation, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 22 ans, \u00e0 des \u00e9lections l\u00e9gislatives en Tunisie. Mon pays d\u2019origine n\u2019en \u00e9tait certes pas \u00e0 son premier scrutin, mais un premier vote libre, d\u00e9mocratique et transparent oui.",
                    "J\u2019avais tremp\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 avec un immense plaisir mon doigt dans l'encre bleue pour valider mon bulletin, partageant cette exp\u00e9rience sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux. Ce fut une f\u00eate et l\u2019accomplissement d\u2019un droit politique.",
                    "En contribuant avec mon bulletin \u00e0 la d\u00e9mocratisation de mon pays, j\u2019avais ressenti le poids historique de cet instant pour les g\u00e9n\u00e9rations d\u2019avant et pour la mienne. Comme j\u2019habite d\u00e9sormais en Suisse, il va sans dire que je souhaiterais absolument participer \u00e0 son processus d\u00e9mocratique.",
                    "Mais pour un quart de la population suisse en \u00e2ge de voter, dont je fais partie, il lui est interdit de glisser son bulletin dans l\u2019urne pour ce scrutin.",
                    "Les quelque 2,3 millions de personnes d\u2019origine \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e9tablies dans le pays n\u2019ont en effet re\u00e7u aucune enveloppe munie de mat\u00e9riel de vote. Pour pouvoir accorder son suffrage lors de votations ou d\u2019\u00e9lections nationales, il faut \u00eatre Suissesse ou Suisse. Certains se demandent d\u2019ailleurs pourquoi devrait-on s'int\u00e9resser \u00e0 cette \u00e9lection \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger.",
                    "Comme journaliste d\u2019origine \u00e9trang\u00e8re travaillant en Suisse, cette question pour moi d\u00e9passe le simple cadre des fronti\u00e8res nationales. Car l\u2019issue de ce scrutin peut avoir en effet une incidence certaine pour des personnes et familles issues de l\u2019immigration, qu\u2019importe o\u00f9 celles-ci se trouvent aujourd\u2019hui.",
                    "L\u2019orientation qui sera prise par le Parlement suisse apr\u00e8s ce scrutin pourra avoir aussi une influence sur leur avenir, voire d\u00e9cider du sort de milliers de personnes en lien avec la question migratoire et la coop\u00e9ration internationale, domaine dans lequel la Suisse excelle au demeurant. Il ne s\u2019agit pas uniquement ici d\u2019un th\u00e8me de politique int\u00e9rieure, mais de l'impact que cette orientation politique pourrait avoir aussi sur la vie de milliers de personnes \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger.",
                    "Bien que je ne puisse voter, je suivrai donc cette \u00e9lection avec attention et circonspection. Et \u00e0 l\u2019instar des personnes exclues de ce scrutin, j\u2019entretiendrai la flamme de pouvoir participer un jour \u00e0 cette danse d\u00e9mocratique.",
                    "Premi\u00e8re observation: en Suisse, les partis politiques jouent un r\u00f4le bien diff\u00e9rent que ce qu\u2019on conna\u00eet en Chine. \u00a0",
                    "Dans le pr\u00e9ambule de la Constitution chinoise, le Parti communiste de la R\u00e9publique populaire de Chine occupe d\u00e9j\u00e0 une place bien plus \u00e9minente que le \u00abDieu Tout-Puissant\u00bb mentionn\u00e9 dans le pr\u00e9ambule de la charte fondamentale suisse.",
                    "Autre diff\u00e9rence: alors que l'article 1 de la Constitution suisse dresse la liste des 26 cantons constitutifs de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration, celui-ci pr\u00e9cise en Chine que le syst\u00e8me socialiste est le fondement de la R\u00e9publique populaire. Et que sa direction par le Parti communiste (PCC) est la marque du socialisme \u00e0 caract\u00e8re chinois.",
                    "Tandis que le poste de secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du PCC constitue en Chine le c\u0153ur du pouvoir, la marche de man\u0153uvre des pr\u00e9sidences des partis est surtout d\u00e9pendante en Suisse de leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 convaincre ou non l\u2019\u00e9lectorat lors d\u2019\u00e9lections.",
                    "Le statut juridique dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient ces formations politiques est faible. Depuis 1999, un bref article, le num\u00e9ro 137, les consacre dans la Constitution. Il y est succinctement dit que \u00ables partis politiques contribuent \u00e0 former l\u2019opinion et la volont\u00e9 populaires\u00bb. Il n\u2019est pas fait mention d\u2019une relation entre l'\u00c9tat et un parti politique en particulier \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il en existe une multitude. Rien qu\u2019au parlement, onze sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et quatre formations si\u00e8gent actuellement au Conseil f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, l\u2019\u00e9quivalent du gouvernement central.",
                    "Le paysage politique suisse \u00e9volue \u00e9galement constamment. Les partis vont et viennent. Certains fusionnent ou changent de nom. Enfin, d\u2019autres sont solides comme le roc. Toujours est-il que ces formations doivent sans cesse se profiler selon les th\u00e8mes du moment dans une course effr\u00e9n\u00e9e aux concepts pour gagner des voix. Il leur faut convaincre l\u2019\u00e9lectorat en proposant des rem\u00e8des contre les maux de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.

Une fiert\u00e9 tout d\u2019abord de vivre dans des d\u00e9mocraties o\u00f9 le droit de vote est profond\u00e9ment ancr\u00e9. Mais une polarisation de la vie politique se fait \u00e9galement de plus en plus jour.",
                    "Voici quelques ann\u00e9es, le magazine New Yorker avait \u00e9crit \u00abqu\u2019aucun forum ne semblait trop petit ou endormi pour \u00eatre polaris\u00e9\u00bb. Mais depuis une dizaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es, la mentalit\u00e9 du \u00abnous contre eux\u00bb s\u2019est impos\u00e9e aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Ce manich\u00e9isme plane comme une menace sur le pays et s\u2019invite dans tous les domaines de la vie quotidienne.",
                    "Cette polarisation agite autant le Capitole \u00e0 Washington que les d\u00eeners familiaux. La Suisse, o\u00f9 la recherche du consensus pr\u00e9vaut, semblait \u00eatre \u00e9pargn\u00e9e par ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne compte tenu de la pr\u00e9sence de bien davantage que deux principaux partis comme aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Le pays en compte six qui se taillent la part du lion, ainsi qu\u2019une douzaine de formations plus petites. Ces partis se disputent les si\u00e8ges du Parlement.",
                    "Mais des signaux montrent aussi qu\u2019en Suisse une polarisation croissante est \u00e0 l\u2019\u0153uvre, s\u2019inscrivant dans le paysage politique. Un r\u00e9cent sondage r\u00e9alis\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la population a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 chez elle une crainte d\u2019une fragmentation de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en une multitude de petits groupes qui pourraient s\u2019opposer jusqu\u2019\u00e0 devenir irr\u00e9conciliables. \u00abDe nos jours, tout est plut\u00f4t noir ou blanc\u00bb, m\u2019a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 une amie suisse. \u00a0",
                    "Pour les analystes, le Covid a constitu\u00e9 un tournant, cr\u00e9ant une nouvelle ligne de d\u00e9marcation nette entre diff\u00e9rents groupements de population.",
                    "Si d\u00e9battre de sujets de fond et de lois avec dans la balance des points de vue diff\u00e9rents est normal dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9mocratique, la polarisation rampante est d\u2019essence \u00e9motionnelle. Elle se manifeste en particulier par une intol\u00e9rance de plus en plus criarde envers celles et ceux qui penseraient aujourd\u2019hui autrement. Il me semble qu\u2019on juge par exemple plus h\u00e2tivement maintenant qu\u2019hier autrui en fonction de ses opinions. Mais je note aussi que des th\u00e8mes sont plus charg\u00e9s \u00e9motionnellement aux \u00c9tats-Unis, comme celui de l\u2019avortement. \u00a0",
                    "Si en Suisse la polarisation n'a pas atteint les extr\u00eames qu\u2019elle conna\u00eet aux \u00c9tats-Unis, le sujet taraude n\u00e9anmoins dans un pays o\u00f9 les partis sont nombreux et o\u00f9 la confiance dans les institutions est \u00e9lev\u00e9e.",

Retranch\u00e9e parmi des clans, la population pourrait \u00eatre tent\u00e9e d\u2019aller chercher des r\u00e9ponses ailleurs que dans le s\u00e9rail politique. \u00a0",

                    "Sch\u00f6n war sie, Silvia, mit ihrem kurzen dunklen Haar und den grossen braunen Augen, die ganze Nacht hatte sie diese Frau anschauen, sie mit den Augen streicheln m\u00fcssen, w\u00e4hrend sie neben ihr schlief.",
                    "Als Silvia am n\u00e4chsten Morgen aufwachte und sagte, \"Wusste ich es doch, du bist eine Schwule\", da war Liva auf und davon.",
                    "Was f\u00fcr ein Schafseckel der Herrgott doch ist, nun hat auch er mich hintergangen, hatte sie geflucht. \"Ich war der Aussatz, ich war das Letzte von allen, war unehelich, dumm, und jetzt auch das noch: schwul. Am liebsten w\u00e4re ich nach Sisikon und h\u00e4tte mich von der Axenstrasse in den Urnersee geworfen, das h\u00e4tte wenigstens keine Sauerei gegeben.\"",
                    "Aber sie hatte ja nicht mal Geld f\u00fcr den Bus.",
                    "Das war 1955 und Liva Tresch gerade einmal zweiundzwanzig Jahre alt, und was das eigentlich ist, das wusste sie nicht: schwul. Auch den Begriff \"lesbisch\" kannte sie nicht. Die anderen sagten, die sind ein Saupack, gruusig, abartig und krank.",
                    "Auch Liva Tresch ging zum Pfarrer nach dieser einen Nacht mit Silvia, sie beichtete, sprach das Vater Unser, zeigte Reue um Gottes Willen, sie weinte und sch\u00e4mte sich ganz f\u00fcrchterlich. Dann rief sie einen Psychiater an, er sollte sie wieder \"normal\" machen.",
                    "Vierzig Franken pro Stunde wollte der Herr Doktor, 400 Stunden brauche er daf\u00fcr. Nach ein paar Sitzungen meinte er, sie solle sich lieber ein f\u00fcr alle Mal damit abfinden.",
                    "Als Liva Tresch im selben Jahr den Schwulenclub \"Blauer Himmel\" im Z\u00fcrcher Niederdorf besuchte, das heutige Restaurant Turm, und diese M\u00e4nner erblickte, da dachte sie bei sich: Die k\u00f6nnen doch nicht schwul sein, so herzige Jungs sind das, immer schick angezogen, immer h\u00f6flich und gepflegt.",
                    "\"Die haben dich nicht bel\u00e4stigt mit dummen Spr\u00fcchen oder angemacht wie die anderen M\u00e4nner\", erinnert sich Liva Tresch, \"die schauten einem in die Augen, mit denen konnte man normal reden\".",
                    "Das M\u00e4nnerbild der jungen Frau war gepr\u00e4gt von Erfahrungen einer Kindheit, die keine beschwingte war. Geboren 1933 in einem F\u00fcrsorgeheim in Hergiswil, ein Bauerndorf am Fusse des Pilatus, kannte Liva Tresch zeitlebens den eigenen Vater nicht. Die Mutter, eines von 18 Kindern und hochintelligent und sch\u00f6n und launisch, musste viel arbeiten f\u00fcr wenig Geld.",
                    "So kam Liva Tresch schon ein Jahr nach ihrer Geburt nach Fl\u00fcelen im Kanton Uri zu den Portmanns, einer Pflegefamilie. Der alte Portmann war ein Flegel, er soff, machte anderen Frauen den Hof und versprach der kleinen Liva 50 Rappen, wenn sie ihm zwischen die Beine fasste, fest zupackte, ihn rieb.",
                    "Mit diesem Geld konnte sie das B\u00e4hnli von Fl\u00fcelen nach Altdorf zu den Pfadfinderinnen nehmen, Flucht in eine Gemeinschaft, wo sie ein bisschen jemand war. Man nannte sie \"Radio\", so \u00fcberdreht und laut war sie. Irgendwann erz\u00e4hlte sie ihrer liebsten Pfadifreundin von dem Gesch\u00e4ft mit den 50 Rappen, und Lisbethli sagte zur Liva: \"\u00c4tsch, dich fasse ich nie wieder an!\"",
                    "Von da an ging sie dem Portmann aus dem Weg.",
                    "Mit sechs Jahren kehrte Liva Tresch zu ihrer Mutter nach Gurtnellen im Kanton Uri zur\u00fcck, die hatte inzwischen den verwitweten Bauer Butzensepp geheiratet, sieben Kinder brachte der mit in die Ehe. Liva wurde eingeschult, sollte ordentlich erzogen werden.",
                    "Nach aussen wurde der Schein gewahrt. Das M\u00e4dchen trug weisse R\u00f6ckchen und eine Schleife im Haar (\"Was habe ich diesen Haarb\u00e4ndel verflucht, alles Trug, eine verlogene Welt\"), daheim aber teilte die Mutter, hoffnungslos \u00fcberfordert, Schl\u00e4ge aus.",
                    "Einer der S\u00f6hne vom Butzensepp war immer hinter der kleinen Liva her, \"figge, figge\", rief er ihr zu, doch sie konnte ihm entwischen. \"Dann ist er halt \u00fcber die H\u00fchner und Schafe, so war das auf diesen H\u00f6fen\", sagt Liva Tresch. \"F\u00fcr mich waren alle M\u00e4nner verdammte Hurenb\u00f6cke.\"",
                    "Als ihre Mutter sie einmal fast bewusstlos schlug, kehrte Liva, trostloses Kind, nach einem Jahr zu den Portmanns zur\u00fcck. Dort wurde sie weder misshandelt noch musste sie Hunger haben. Sie schlief bei der Pflegemutter.",
                    "Die Portmanns hatten getrennte Schlafzimmer, alle wussten, dass der Mann bei anderen Frauen war. Gleichwohl kam er immer wieder, des nachts, er riss die T\u00fcre auf, schrie \"Dori, hopp!\". Da ist die Pflegemutter auf und in sein Zimmer. Sp\u00e4ter kam sie mit verheulten Augen zur\u00fcck ins Bett geschlichen.",
                    "Liva Tresch bewunderte ihre Pflegemutter, wie sie dieses d\u00fcstere Leben meisterte neben einem Mann, der seine Finger nie bei sich lassen konnte.",
                    "Und sie mochte es, wenn Frau Portmann mit ihren weichen, warmen H\u00e4nden ihr das Kleid am R\u00fccken zukn\u00f6pfte. Oder sie mit dem Waschlappen einseifte. Ber\u00fchrungen waren rar.",
                    "\"Ich war die Uneheliche, die Unehrliche, eine Unreine, die man nicht anfasst.\" Bei Z\u00e4rtlichkeiten dachte sie an eine Mutter, liebevoll und nachsichtig, die sie nicht hatte.",
                    "So wurde der K\u00f6rper der Frau f\u00fcr Liva Tresch zur Heimat.",
                    "Dabei w\u00e4re das M\u00e4dchen lieber ein Bub gewesen. Mit vierzehn betete sie zum Bruder Klaus, ein Wunder m\u00f6ge bittesch\u00f6n geschehen und es wachse auch bei ihr so ein Ding zwischen den Beinen heraus. Den Buben konnte ja nichts passieren, die waren nicht Freiwild.",

                    "Schon als Kind war Liva kr\u00e4ftig, sie konnte anpacken, pr\u00fcgelte sich mit Jungs, den M\u00e4dchen half sie beim Schulsacktragen. R\u00f6cke hasste sie, sie trug Hosen, auch sp\u00e4ter noch, aus Manchester, dazu dicke Pullover, Heilandsandalen, selbstgestrickte Wollsocken.",
                    "Vielleicht munkelte man auch deshalb, die Tresch, das sei doch eine Lesbe.",
                    "Dass Liva Tresch homosexuell war, war ihr damals \u2013 sie war sechzehn und wollte sich umbringen, Schluss machen \u2013 nicht klar. \"Ich habe schwul gelebt, ohne es gewusst zu haben. Ich hatte keinen Begriff daf\u00fcr, ich ahnte bloss: Da ist eine Sehnsucht nach N\u00e4he in mir, die ich nur mit Frauen stillen konnte.\"",
                    "Mit Sexualit\u00e4t hatte das nichts zu tun, die machte bloss alles kaputt. Dachte Liva daran, hatte sie dieses grosse, harte, widerliche, violette Ding vom alten Portmann vor Augen.",
                    "Auch sp\u00e4ter wird Liva Tresch ihre Freundinnen streicheln und verw\u00f6hnen, ohne sich selbst hinzugeben. \"Ich hatte in meinem Leben nur einen Orgasmus, ich konnte mir gar nicht vorstellen, dass es meinen Freundinnen gefallen k\u00f6nnte, mich zu ber\u00fchren.\"",
                    "Lust war f\u00fcr sie wie ein Appetit, den man stillt, prompt und ohne Aufheben. \"Vor dem Ausgang machte ich mir es schnell selber, das dauerte keine zwei Minuten, t\u00e4-t\u00e4m. Dann war Ruhe im Stall.\"",
                    "Einmal, im Jahr 1951, fuhr Liva Tresch \u00fcber Nacht ins Tessin, sie musste weg, wollte atmen, in Bellinzona fand sie einen Job als Dienstm\u00e4dchen, in Giubiasco arbeitete sie in einer Fabrik, f\u00fcr 32 Rappen die Stunde, der Hunger schwellte ihren Bauch auf, ein Horror, sagt Liva Tresch heute.",
                    "Trotzdem denkt sie gerne an diese Zeit zur\u00fcck, die Leute waren gut zu ihr, eine Handvoll wenigstens, man sagte liebevoll ",
                    " zu ihr, eine Verr\u00fcckte, aber Heilige sei sie gewesen.",

                    "Jahre danach fand Liva Tresch in Z\u00fcrich eine Stelle in einem Fotogesch\u00e4ft, sie verbrachte viel Zeit in Schwulenbars und wurde bald zur Szenefotografin. Als eine der wenigen dokumentierte sie das Z\u00fcrcher Milieu der Schwulen und Lesben in den 1960er- und 70er-Jahren. Sie f\u00fchlte sich wohl dort, sie geh\u00f6rte dazu, tanzte, trank.",
                    "Die Szene, ihre Ersatzfamilie. Mit einer Frau ins Bett mochte Liva Tresch zu jener Zeit nicht. \"Jede machte mit jeder rum, sie gingen dir an die Br\u00fcste und wollten sofort mit dir in die Pfanne. In der einen Woche hiess es dann \"Ich liebe dich\", in der Woche darauf \"Ich hasse dich\", dann kam die n\u00e4chste dran. Doch nie war von Respekt die Rede, das stiess mich ab.\"",
                    "Vielleicht sei das halt so, sagt Liva Tresch: \"Wenn man immer ausgegrenzt wird und einem alle einreden, wie gruusig man ist, verliert man am Ende den Respekt vor sich selbst.\"",
                    "Meist waren die Bars gemischt, M\u00e4nner und Frauen. Manche lebten ihre Homosexualit\u00e4t offen und selbstbewusst aus, andere wollten sich bedeckt halten. Sie waren verheiratet, mochten nicht ausgegrenzt oder angefeindet werden.",

                    "\"Diese Bars waren der einzige Ort, wo man sich zeigen konnte, wie man wirklich war. Man kann sich das heute nicht mehr vorstellen. Aber damals kamen Homosexuelle in der Gesellschaft gar nicht vor. Es gab keinen Platz f\u00fcr uns, es durfte uns nicht geben. Wir waren unsichtbar.\"",
                    "Besonders f\u00fcr Frauen war wenig Raum f\u00fcr Lebensformen abseits des b\u00fcrgerlichen Ideals als Ehefrau und Mutter. Umso wichtiger war Verschwiegenheit, und die Fotografin Liva Tresch war verschwiegen. Manchmal kamen Herren auf sie zu, in feinen Anz\u00fcgen, mit Schnauz und Hut, sie boten ihr viel Geld f\u00fcr Bilder, wohl, um die darauf Abgebildeten zu denunzieren.",
                    "Oder es tauchte die Polizei auf, um das Homosexuellenregister mit Informationen aufzuf\u00fcllen (dieses Register wurde erst 1978 abgeschafft). Geredet wurde aber auch in den eigenen Kreisen.",
                    "Oft war nicht das gesellschaftliche Umfeld das Problem, der Feind hockte in der eigenen Szene. Missgunst, Eifersucht, der fehlende Respekt voreinander, das habe viel kaputtgemacht, erinnert sich Liva Tresch.",

                    "Von ihren Freundinnen waren einige politisch aktiv und gingen auf die Strasse, Liva Tresch aber wollte das nicht einleuchten: \"Lesbischsein hat mit Politik nichts zu tun\", fand sie damals. Lesbische Frauen organisierten sich in Z\u00fcrich bereits Anfang der 1930er-Jahre, eine politische Bewegung hat sich aber erst wieder ab 1970 formiert.",

                    "Heute sieht sie das anders. \"Politische Prozesse brauchen Geduld, schliesslich kann man einem gr\u00fcnen Apfel am Baum auch nicht befehlen, ab heute bist du eine reife Berner Rose.\" Das Engagement der lesbischen Frauen in den 1970er- und 1980er-Jahren habe viel zum Ausbau der Rechte von Homosexuellen beigetragen, wie sie heute im Gesetz verankert sind.",
                    "1968 er\u00f6ffnete Liva Tresch zusammen mit Katrin in Z\u00fcrich ein Fotogesch\u00e4ft mit eigenem Labor. Sie hatte die Frau einige Jahre davor kennen und lieben gelernt.",
                    "Die Beziehung hielt zwanzig Jahre, war voller grosser Wunder und kleiner Freuden, dann verliess Katrin sie wegen einer anderen Frau. Sex wollte sie all die Jahre keinen, Liva akzeptierte das, aus Respekt und aus Liebe.",

                    "Sie musste die Fotografie aufgeben und das Gesch\u00e4ft, verlor aufs Mal ihr Einkommen und den Mut. \"Damals war ich noch einmal richtig tief unten. Der Fotoapparat war mir das Wichtigste.\"",
                    "Fast ein ganzes Leben habe sie gebraucht, um zu sich selbst zu finden, sagt Liva Tresch. Um zu erkennen: Wer sich verleugnet, zerbricht daran. Das klingt schrecklich pathetisch, sie, die inzwischen Gelassene, weiss das.",
                    "\"Ich habe mich vers\u00f6hnt mit mir, mich lieben gelernt. Und habe die Wut auf meine Widersacher verloren, von denen ich in meinem Leben genug hatte.\"",

                    "An manchen Tagen fragt sich Liva Tresch, was sie in ihrem Leben geleistet hat und was sie noch bieten kann. \"Meine Liebe, was sonst\", sagt sie dann, leiser als \u00fcblich. Die Frau h\u00e4lt hohe St\u00fccke auf ein authentisches Leben, eines, das auf Selbstachtung baut und darauf, nur das zu tun, was im Einklang steht mit den eigenen \u00dcberzeugungen und Gef\u00fchlen.",
                    "Berichtet Liva Tresch aus ihrem Leben, erz\u00e4hlt sie auch die Geschichte von Li und Vera, sie waren lange ein Vorbild: Beide waren ledig, sie lebten in einer gemeinsamen Wohnung, hatten Arbeit, die eine war Krankenschwester, die andere B\u00fcroangestellte, sie waren unabh\u00e4ngig, offen, selbstbewusst, hatten ihre Liebe gelebt, ganz so, als w\u00e4re es das Normalste auf der Welt.",

                    "Die politische Einbindung der Indigenen, die den f\u00fcnften Kontinent seit \u00fcber 60'000 Jahren bewohnen, ist historisch vorbelastet. Im Unterschied etwa zum Nachbarland Neuseeland hat Australien bei der Gr\u00fcndung des modernen Bundesstaates keinen Vertrag mit den Aborigines abgeschlossen. Sie blieben nach Ankunft der ersten weissen Siedler im Jahre 1788 lange ohne jegliche Rechte, wurden erst 1967 als B\u00fcrger:innen anerkannt.",
                    "Veri, der f\u00fcr das Aarauer Zentrum f\u00fcr Demokratie (ZDA) sowie f\u00fcr das \"Zentrum f\u00fcr Deliberative Demokratie und Globale Gouvernanz\" (Centre for Deliberative Democracy and Global Governance) an der Universit\u00e4t der australischen Hauptstadt Canberra t\u00e4tig ist, sieht f\u00fcr die Niederlage an der Urne auch Gr\u00fcnde im demokratischen System.",
                    "Es ist ein System, bei dessen Entwurf sich die Verfassungsv\u00e4ter Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts von der Schweiz inspirieren liessen. So setzt eine Verfassungs\u00e4nderung hier wie dort eine Mehrheit von Volk und St\u00e4nden (in Australien \u2018Staaten\u2018) voraus.",
                    "Es gibt aber auch erhebliche Unterschiede \u2013 mit dem Resultat, dass die Erfolgsquote von Regierungsvorlagen in australischen Volksabstimmungen markant von jener im direktdemokratischen Vorbildstaats Schweiz abweicht: W\u00e4hrend in \"Down Under\" eine von f\u00fcnf Vorlagen angenommen wird, schaffen in der Schweiz fast drei Viertel diese H\u00fcrde.",
                    "\"Seit dem Zweiten Weltkrieg ist es in Australien in \u00fcber 30 Abstimmungen keiner Regierung gelungen, eine Verfassungs\u00e4nderung gegen den Willen der Opposition durchzubringen\", sagt Veri. Die aktuelle Volksabstimmung best\u00e4tige drei grunds\u00e4tzliche Defizite der australischen Demokratie, wie sie bereits beim gescheiterten Referendum \u00fcber die Einf\u00fchrung der Republik 1999 deutlich wurden: Sie betreffen das Wahlsystem, den F\u00f6rderalismus und die Stimmpflicht.",
                    "\"Im australischen Parlament, das im Mehrheitswahlrecht gew\u00e4hlt wird, ist es fast unm\u00f6glich, tragf\u00e4hige L\u00f6sungen zu finden, die in einer Volksabstimmung bestehen k\u00f6nnen\", betont Veri. Im Unterschied dazu sind in der Schweiz die vier gr\u00f6ssten Parteien im Parlament (mit gegen 80% der Abgeordnetensitze) auch in der Regierung vertreten, sodass die Bundesverfassung mit der Zeit gehen kann: So haben sich in den letzten 175 Jahren Volk und St\u00e4nde in der Schweiz in 173 F\u00e4llen f\u00fcr Anpassungen und bei zwei Gelegenheiten 1874 und 1999 f\u00fcr eine Totalrevision gewinnen lassen.",
                    "Eine zweite H\u00fcrde f\u00fcr erfolgreiche Verfassungsprojekte macht Veri beim australischen F\u00f6rderalismus aus, \"der postkoloniale Z\u00fcge\" tr\u00e4gt. Nur sechs Territorien sind als vollwertige Bundesstaaten anerkannt. Der Landesteil mit dem gr\u00f6ssten Anteil indigener Menschen \u2013 die Northern\u00a0Territories \u2013 wird in einer Volksabstimmung nicht als Staat mitgerechnet\". Ebenso wenig wie das \u00b4Australia Capital Territory\u00b4\u00a0mit der Hauptstadt Canberra, wo am 14. Oktober \u00fcber 60% f\u00fcr das Indigenen-Mitspracherecht votierten.",
                    "Als dritte grosse Herausforderung bezeichnet Veri die in Australien geltende Stimmpflicht: \"Eine Volksabstimmung wird von vielen Australier:innen eher als unn\u00f6tige B\u00fcrde, denn als Chance auf Mitbestimmung betrachtet. Dazu tr\u00e4gt die Stimmpflicht nicht zu besser informierten B\u00fcrger:innen bei, sondern zu einem Vorteil f\u00fcr den Status Quo, da schlecht informierte Stimmende mitentscheiden m\u00fcssen\".",
                    "Im Vorfeld der aktuellen Abstimmung \u00e4usserte sich dies in einer Kampagne der Mitsprachegegner:innen unter dem Motto \"If you don\u2019t know, vote no\" (\"wenn Du nicht weisst, wie stimmen, dann stimme nein\") Dazu kursierten viele Falschinformationen \u00fcber eine m\u00f6gliche k\u00fcnftige Vetorolle der Indigenen in der australischen Politik im Falle eines \u2018Ja\u2019.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

                    "Laut Francesco Veri bildet die gescheiterte Abstimmung vom 14. Oktober\u00a0\"nicht nur eine Niederlage f\u00fcr die Aborigines in Australien, sondern auch eine Niederlage f\u00fcr die Demokratie im Land\".",
                    "Eine Neuauflage k\u00f6nne in der Zukunft nur dann Aussichten auf Erfolg haben, wenn sie von einer konservativen Regierung ausgehe. Dazu empfiehlt Veri Reformen des F\u00f6rderalismus und des Stimmrechtes \u2013 wiederum nach Vorbild der Schweiz.",

Die Idee der Meinungsfreiheit basiert auf der aufkl\u00e4rerischen Vorstellung, dass wir alle denkende, vern\u00fcnftige Wesen sind, die ihre Meinung im Dialog bilden.",
                    "\"F\u00fcr die Demokratie ist die Meinungsfreiheit und auch die Informationsfreiheit wesentlich\", sagt Hertig. Das Gleiche gelte f\u00fcr die Forschung: \"Fortschritt ist nur m\u00f6glich, wenn die vorherrschende Meinung in Frage gestellt werden kann.\"",
                    "SWI #Meinungsfreiheit-Serie",
                    "Im Prinzip sollte alles glasklar sein. Sowohl in der Allgemeinen Erkl\u00e4rung der Menschenrechte (1948) als auch im UNO-Pakt \u00fcber b\u00fcrgerliche und politische Rechte (1966) heisst es in Artikel 19: \"Jede und jeder hat das Recht auf freie Meinungs\u00e4usserung; dieses Recht schliesst die Freiheit ein, ohne R\u00fccksicht auf Grenzen Informationen und Gedankengut jeder Art zu suchen, zu empfangen und zu verbreiten, sei es m\u00fcndlich, schriftlich oder in gedruckter Form, durch Kunst oder durch ein anderes Medium seiner Wahl.\"",
                    "In Europa best\u00e4tigt die Europ\u00e4ische Menschenrechts-Konvention (1950) die Meinungsfreiheit als rechtsverbindliches Recht (Artikel 10). Die Schweiz verankert diese Grundfreiheit in Artikel 16 ihrer Verfassung von 1999.",
                    "In der Praxis bleibt jedoch vieles umstritten. Regierungen auf der ganzen Welt sch\u00fctzen das Recht auf freie Meinungs\u00e4usserung nicht, sondern unterminieren es zunehmend. In anderen Teilen der Welt nutzen Einzelne und Gruppen den Begriff \"Meinungsfreiheit\", um diskriminierende und hasserf\u00fcllte \u00c4usserungen zu rechtfertigen. Doch obwohl sie ein universelles Recht ist, ist die Meinungsfreiheit kein absolutes Recht. Sie zu gew\u00e4hrleisten und anzuwenden, ist immer eine Gratwanderung.",
                    "In einer neuen Serie befasst sich SWI swissinfo.ch mit diesen verschiedenen Aspekten, Herausforderungen, Meinungen und Entwicklungen rund um die Meinungsfreiheit \u2013 sowohl in der Schweiz als auch weltweit.",

Das heisst: Grunds\u00e4tzlich darf niemand vom Staat daran gehindert werden, seine Meinung zu \u00e4ussern.",
                    "\"Das Recht, eine Meinung zu haben, ist nicht einschr\u00e4nkbar\", erkl\u00e4rt sie. So ist es also nicht strafbar, eine rassistische Einstellung zu haben. Rassistische \u00c4usserungen zu verbreiten, hingegen schon.",
                    "Denn: Auch der Meinungsfreiheit sind gesetzliche Schranken gesetzt. \"Die Freiheit, eine Meinung zu \u00e4ussern, ist nicht absolut\", sagt Hertig. Ein absolutes Recht ist eines, das niemals eingeschr\u00e4nkt werden kann \u2013 auch nicht in aussergew\u00f6hnlichen Lagen wie Krieg, Krise oder Pandemie. \"Es gibt nur ganz wenige absolute Rechte, die uneingeschr\u00e4nkt gelten, zum Beispiel das Folterverbot.\" Foltern ist nie erlaubt, weder im Krieg noch im Frieden, und auch nicht, wenn die Informationen, die man durch die Folter zu erlangen erhofft, viele Leben sch\u00fctzen k\u00f6nnten.",

Ist das eine Einschr\u00e4nkung der Meinungsfreiheit? Theoretisch schon, so Hertig. Aber: \"Die Meinungsfreiheit sch\u00fctzt nur vor Eingriffen durch den Staat, sie bindet nicht direkt private Akteure wie Youtube.\" Klagen kann man gest\u00fctzt auf die Meinungsfreiheit also nur gegen den Staat, nicht gegen Private.",

                    "Nur: \"Der Staat muss geeignete Massnahmen treffen, um die Meinungsfreiheit gegen Einschr\u00e4nkungen durch Private zu sch\u00fctzen\", sagt Hertig. Das gilt auch im Internet und dort haben gewisse Plattformen mittlerweile eine Monopolstellung: \"Youtube und andere soziale Medien sind heute wesentlich, damit sich B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrger in eine Debatte einbringen k\u00f6nnen.\"",
                    "Der Schutz der Meinungsfreiheit im Netz ist allerdings schwierig zu gew\u00e4hren, weil die Firmen ihren Sitz h\u00e4ufig im Ausland haben und einseitige staatliche Regulierungen zu einer rechtlichen Fragmentierung f\u00fchren. Darum seien international einheitlichere Regeln und mehr Transparenz dringend, sagt Hertig. \"Es muss klar sein, was warum wegkommt\". Das kann auch durch \u00fcberstaatliche Initiativen geschehen. So haben grosse IT-Konzerne, darunter Facebook und Youtube, mit der EU eine ",

Rechtlich gesehen ist es nicht grunds\u00e4tzlich verboten, falsche Fakten zu verbreiten. Auch sei es teilweise schwierig zu definieren, was die \"Wahrheit\" sei. Und in manchen asiatischen L\u00e4ndern werde zum Beispiel unter dem Vorwand von Fake News staatliche Zensur betrieben. \"Es geh\u00f6rt ein St\u00fcck weit zu einer Demokratie, dass auch unliebsame Inhalte sichtbar sind\", sagt sie.",
                    "\"Je diverser das Meinungsbild, desto besser geht es der Demokratie\", sagt Florian Steger, Medizinethiker und Direktor des Instituts f\u00fcr Geschichte, Theorie und Ethik der Medizin der Universit\u00e4t Ulm. Zuh\u00f6ren sei ein notwendiger Akt des demokratischen Prozesses. Eine echte L\u00f6sung des Problems Falschinformation sei L\u00f6schen ohnehin nicht, denn \"die Meinung bleibt in den K\u00f6pfen\".",
                    "Viel besser w\u00e4ren laut Steger B\u00fcrgerdialoge und transparente Kommunikation. \"Gerade in einer Pandemie wie dieser ist die Evidenzbasis oft unzureichend und die Regierungen m\u00fcssen aus Vorsicht agieren.\" Diese Wissensl\u00fccken seien zu benennen \u2013 auch wenn Unwissen f\u00fcr viele Menschen schwierig zu ertragen sei.",
                    "Wenn Beitr\u00e4ge gel\u00f6scht w\u00fcrden, sagt Steger, werde es ganz generell gef\u00e4hrlich. \"Man darf nur l\u00f6schen, was den Staat im Innersten erodiert. Und f\u00fcr solche L\u00f6schungen sind Polizei und Gerichte zust\u00e4ndig.\" Konkret: Wenn die Kernzellen der Demokratie mit Gewalt bedroht w\u00fcrden, wie im Fall des Sturms auf das US-Kapitol, dann sei die Grenze des Sagbaren erreicht.",
                    "Einige Kritikerinnen und Kritiker der Corona-Schutzmassnahmen beklagen, dass sie wegen ihrer Meinung angefeindet oder als \"Corona-Leugner\" bezeichnet w\u00fcrden und deshalb die Meinungsfreiheit ausgeh\u00f6hlt werde. Hierzu sagt Maya Hertig: \"Wer eine kontroverse Meinung \u00e4ussert, muss auch zugespitzte Meinungen der Gegenseite aushalten. Es geh\u00f6rt dazu, dass man dann rhetorisch angegriffen wird. Es gibt kein Recht, nicht kritisiert zu werden.\"",
                    "Ein weiteres Argument von \"Corona-Skeptikern\": Es herrsche ein gesellschaftliches Klima, in dem keine abweichende Meinung ge\u00e4ussert werden d\u00fcrfe. So schreibt zum Beispiel das Web-Portal Rubikon, das Verschw\u00f6rungstheorien nahesteht: \"Versuchen Sie einmal, im Freundes- und Familienkreis die Gef\u00e4hrlichkeit von Covid-19 zu 'leugnen'. Versuchen Sie, den Sinn und Zweck des Impfens in Frage zu stellen. Es kann sein, dass Sie so aggressiven Gegenwind ernten, dass Sie beim n\u00e4chsten Mal lieber stumm bleiben.\" Anders zu denken sei sozial ge\u00e4chtet und Meinungsfreiheit damit de facto nicht m\u00f6glich.",
                    "\"Meinungsfreiheit braucht nat\u00fcrlich ein gewisses gesellschaftliches Klima\", sagt Hertig. \"Wenn ein Klima herrscht, das zu Selbstzensur f\u00fchrt, ist das ein Problem.\" Dazu geh\u00f6ren Gewalt und Drohung, Entlassungen, aber auch vehemente verbale Angriffe auf Andersdenkende.",
                    "\"Shitstorms\" k\u00f6nnen da laut Hertig ebenfalls ein Problem darstellen. Nur sehen sich oft jene als Opfer, die den eigentlich aggressiven Part einnehmen: \"H\u00e4ufig wird der gesellschaftliche Druck zu 'political correctness' \u00fcbertrieben dargestellt und das f\u00fchrt zu einer Opfer-T\u00e4ter-Umkehr: Opfer ist der weisse Rassist, nicht der mit Hassrede konfrontierte Schwarze.\"",
                    "Drohungen gegen Wissenschaftlerinnen und Politiker haben w\u00e4hrend der Pandemie zugenommen \u2013 von Gewalt und Drohung gegen Corona-Skeptiker hingegen ist zumindest in der Schweiz nichts zu sp\u00fcren. Jede und jeder kann seine Meinung frei \u00e4ussern und an Corona-Demonstrationen teilnehmen.",
                    "Ob aber das soziale Umfeld der Rebellen deswegen Freudenspr\u00fcnge auff\u00fchrt, ist eine andere Frage. \"Wenn Corona-Skeptiker sich eingeschr\u00e4nkt f\u00fchlen, etwas zu sagen, liegt das h\u00e4ufig nicht an eingeschr\u00e4nkter Meinungsfreiheit, sondern an sozialer Kontrolle\", sagt Urte Scholz, Professorin f\u00fcr Angewandte Sozial- und Gesundheitspsychologie an der Universit\u00e4t Z\u00fcrich.",
                    "Wenn manche \"Corona-Skeptiker\" also die Meinungsfreiheit bedroht sehen, k\u00f6nnen sie damit h\u00f6chstens den sozialen Druck meinen, der es erschwert, eine Abweichende Meinung zu \u00e4ussern.",
                    "Mit sozialer Kontrolle versuchen Menschen, ihre Mitmenschen zu einem bestimmten Verhalten zu bewegen. \"Soziale Kontrolle findet grunds\u00e4tzlich statt, ob wir das wollen oder nicht\", erkl\u00e4rt Scholz. \"In einem sozialen Miteinander passiert sie, weil wir aufeinander reagieren.\" Und gerade in einer Pandemie k\u00f6nne soziale Kontrolle h\u00e4ufiger sein, weil sie durch die offiziellen Verhaltensempfehlungen und -regeln legitimiert sei.",
                    "Doch: Es gibt verschiedene Wege, soziale Kontrolle auszu\u00fcben. Manche f\u00fchren beim Gegen\u00fcber zu positiven Gef\u00fchlen, andere zu negativen. So kommt es durch Bestrafung, N\u00f6rgeln, Liebes- oder Freundschaftsentzug oder durch das Erzeugen eines schlechten Gewissens bei den \"kontrollierten\" Personen zu Scham oder \u00c4rger.",
                    "In Studien zu sozialer Kontrolle in Bezug auf das Gesundheitsverhalten bei Paaren fanden Scholz und ihr Team heraus, dass diese negativen Strategien wenig bringen. Sie konnten keinen Zusammenhang feststellen zwischen \"negativer\" sozialer Kontrolle und einem ges\u00fcnderen Verhalten. Im Gegenteil: Die kontrollierten Personen machten h\u00e4ufig gerade nicht das, was ihre Partner erwarteten \u2013 entweder demonstrativ oder heimlich.",
                    "Anders reagierten jene Personen, die mit positiven Strategien der sozialen Kontrolle konfrontiert waren. Zu den positiven Strategien geh\u00f6ren Diskutieren, Verhandeln, \u00dcberreden, das Aufzeigen von Vorteilen des angestrebten Verhaltens, der Verweis auf positive Beispiele und Komplimente. \u00dcbte der Partner solche positiv erlebte soziale Kontrolle aus, \u00e4nderten die \"kontrollierten\" Personen ihr Verhalten eher und f\u00fchlten sich besser.",
                    "Negative soziale Kontrolle, wie sie gegenw\u00e4rtig in der \u00d6ffentlichkeit zum Beispiel durch b\u00f6se Blicke oder schroffes Zurechtweisen vorkommt, sei zwar in einer Pandemie nicht un\u00fcblich. Doch: \"Unter Umst\u00e4nden reagieren manche Menschen dann eben gegenteilig: Sie sehen eine Diktatur am Werk und weigern sich, die Massnahmen einzuhalten.\" Diese Menschen f\u00fchlten sich bevormundet, widersetzten sich und versuchten, ihre Autonomie wiederherzustellen.",
                    "Die Forschungsresultate von Urte Scholz zeigen: Positive Strategien sozialer Kontrolle w\u00e4re auch w\u00e4hrend der Pandemie w\u00fcnschenswert. Das hiesse: Mit Kritikern der Schutzmassnahmen in Dialog treten, sich austauschen, andere Meinungen zulassen und ein Verhalten nicht \u00fcber Druck oder negative Emotionen \u00e4ndern wollen.",
                    "Wenn jemand ohne Maske im Tram sitzt, k\u00f6nnte man zum Beispiel sagen: \"F\u00fcr mich w\u00e4re es wichtig, dass Sie eine Maske tragen, weil ich mich dann wohler f\u00fchle.\" Oder: \"Sie haben die Maske bestimmt vergessen, das ist mir auch schon passiert.\" Oder dem anderen eine frische Maske anbieten.",
                    "Sind solche Versuche nicht naiv und zum Scheitern verurteilt? \"Ob das Gegen\u00fcber auf ein solches Angebot eingeht, h\u00e4ngt stark vom sozialen Kontext ab\", sagt Scholz. Einen Versuch sei es aber wert \u2013 und allemal besser, als ihn schlicht einen \"Idioten\" zu nennen.",

Die d\u00e4nischen Forschenden merken in ihrem Bericht an, das \"Netz-Durchsuchungs-Gesetz\" beinhalte rechtsstaatliche Garantien und Schutz der freien Meinungs\u00e4usserung, die nicht von allen L\u00e4ndern gleichermassen \u00fcbernommen wurden.",

Nutzerprofile sperren, solange die Posts keine Gesetze im Inland brechen.",
                    "Ungarns Justizministerin liess im Februar (auf Facebook) verlauten, die grossen sozialen Medien wollten \"die Sichtbarkeit christlicher, konservativer, rechter Meinungen\" einschr\u00e4nken.\u00a0",
                    "In der Schweiz fehlen bisher spezifisch auf die sozialen Medien abgestimmten Regulierungen. Netz-Aktivistin Jolanda Spiess-Hegglin, die mit der Organisation Netzcourage an vorderster Front gegen Hass im Netz k\u00e4mpft, sieht Handlungsbedarf. Sie sagt: \"Eine Bundesr\u00e4tin m\u00fcsste entscheiden: Jetzt berufen wir eine Arbeitsgruppe ein und arbeiten ein Hate-Speech-Gesetz aus.\"",

                    "Ethikerin Grimm wiederum betont, nicht nur die Politik stehe in der Pflicht: \"Es ist auch eine Verantwortung der Tech-Unternehmen, eine Verantwortung zur Selbstkontrolle.\"",
                    "In einigen L\u00e4ndern rufen Facebook oder Twitter mittlerweile selbst nach deutlicheren Regulierungen. Spiess-Hegglin \u00fcberzeugt das nicht: \"Wenn Unternehmen vom Staat klarere Regeln fordern, ist das, als ob ein M\u00f6rder sagen w\u00fcrde: 'Ihr m\u00fcsst mir doch kein Messer verkaufen, sonst morde ich halt!'\"",
                    "Die kommerziellen Sozialen Plattformen werden sich kaum von sich aus wesentlich \u00e4ndern. Das Grundproblem sei strukturell, so Grimm: \"Nachrichten, die sehr spektakul\u00e4r sind, die etwas \u00fcber die Wahrheit hinausgehen oder vor allen Dingen die Gem\u00fcter erhitzen, werden besonders h\u00e4ufig angeklickt. Und Klicks sind nat\u00fcrlich das Gesch\u00e4ft der sozialen Medien.\" Spiess-Hegglin fasst es so zusammen: \"Die sozialen Medien lassen Hassrede zu, weil es Klicks und damit Geld bringt.\"",
                    "Was ist der Ausweg? \"Es br\u00e4uchte ein alternatives soziales Netzwerk, das nach den Prinzipien eines \u00f6ffentlich-rechtlichen Verst\u00e4ndnisses funktioniert, das Kommunikation erm\u00f6glicht, ohne dass es kommerziell ausgebeutet wird\", fordert Grimm.",
                    "Was der Professorin vorschwebt, existiert bereits. Zum Beispiel in Taiwan: Die Plattform PTT, h\u00e4ufig beschrieben als das Reddit Taiwans, wird von der Nationalen Universit\u00e4t finanziert, unabh\u00e4ngig von Werbegeldern oder Shareholdern.",

Ein Beispiel: In Taiwan verlangte die Zivilgesellschaft erfolgreich nach mehr Transparenz in der Politik. \"Diese hart erk\u00e4mpfte, radikale Transparenz hinsichtlich politischer Kampagnenfinanzierung wurde zur Norm.\" Dieser beugt sich in Taiwan nun auch Facebook und legt politische Werbung in Echtzeit offen: \"Wir haben daf\u00fcr kein Gesetz eingef\u00fchrt.

                    "\"Es geht darum, eine Tugendkultur der sozialen Medien von der Nutzerseite her aufzubauen\", ist Grimm \u00fcberzeugt. \"Wir brauchen ein neues Narrativ. Dieses Narrativ m\u00fcsste optimistischer und werteorientierter sein.\" Es brauche Anstrengungen mit politischer Unterst\u00fctzung, um Alternativen zu den kommerziellen Tech-Giganten zu schaffen. \"Das m\u00fcsste mindestens europ\u00e4isch sein\" \u2013 die Schweiz sei da mitgemeint.",

In den kleinen Gruppen, mit denen er H\u00e4user besetzte, konnte er \u00fcber antisemitische Stereotypen aufkl\u00e4ren, etwa, dass nicht alle J\u00fcd:innen reich sind. Als er sich aus dem Tal rauswagte und sich globalen Themen widmete, merkte er, dass der Antisemitismus nicht nur in seinem Tal allgegenw\u00e4rtig war.",
                    "An Sitzungen erlebte er regelm\u00e4ssig Ausf\u00e4lle gegen Israel: \"Parolen wie 'Wir werden euer Land niederbrennen' waren nicht an mich gerichtet, aber ich habe sie geh\u00f6rt.\" An Demonstrationen gegen den Irakkrieg oder das Weltwirtschaftsforum WEF verst\u00f6rten Malcus die unreflektierte Verwendung von Karikaturen von Kapitalisten, die nicht selten wie antisemitische Karikaturen wirkten.",
                    "Eine unterkomplexe Kapitalismuskritik ist anschlussf\u00e4hig an antisemitische Weltbilder, in denen angebliche \"Strippenzieher\" die Kontrolle innehaben, und bedient sich oft judenfeindlicher Bilder mit langer Tradition. Das zeigte etwa die jungsozialistische Partei Juso, die w\u00e4hrend eines Abstimmungskampfs 2016 eine Karikatur ver\u00f6ffentlichte, in der ein \"Spekulant\" als Mann mit grosser Nase, Zylinder und Schl\u00e4fenlocken dargestellt wurde.",

                    "Die Ausf\u00e4lle gegen Israel, die Malcus in den 2000ern erlebt hatte, geh\u00f6rten da schon seit Jahrzehnten zu etwas, was die Schweizer Linken zumindest in Kauf genommen hat. In seiner Z\u00fcrcher Kindheit w\u00e4hrend des Zweiten Weltkriegs in den 1940ern haben Kinder Steine nach Emanuel Hurwitz geschmissen und ihm antisemitische Beleidigungen nachgerufen.",
                    "\"Diesen offensichtlichen Antisemitismus habe ich sp\u00e4ter in der Linken nie erlebt\", stellt er im Gespr\u00e4ch mit swissinfo.ch klar. Nach dem Studium engagierte sich Hurwitz in der sozialdemokratischen Partei. Er wurde ins Parlament des Kanton Z\u00fcrich gew\u00e4hlt, politisierte im linken Fl\u00fcgel. Die Haltung der SP zum Nahostkonflikt empfand Hurwitz in den 1970ern als reflektiert.",
                    "Doch dies habe sich mit dem Beginn des Libanon-Kriegs, in dem Israel als Aggressor auftrat, ge\u00e4ndert. \"Ab 1982 herrschte unglaubliche Erregung in der SP\", erinnert sich Hurwitz. Er sei als j\u00fcdischer Vertreter in der Linken an \"unz\u00e4hlige Podiumsdiskussionen\" eingeladen worden, die sich dann \"als reine Propagandaveranstaltungen zugunsten der PLO\" entpuppten. Dabei seien ihm \"seltsame Argumentationsmuster\" aufgefallen: \"Israel war das B\u00f6se und die pal\u00e4stinensische PLO hat begeisterte Zustimmung erfahren.\"",
                    "Der \"Hass und Fanatismus, der da durchbrach\", habe ihn \u00fcberrascht und \u00fcberrumpelt. F\u00fcr diese D\u00e4monisierung findet er nur eine Erkl\u00e4rung: \"Antisemitismus.\" Hurwitz, von Beruf Psychiater, hat damals versucht, das seinen Genoss:innen zu erkl\u00e4ren: Wie eine jahrhundertealte Tradition antisemitischer Vorurteile in einer politisch aufgeladenen Situation an die Oberfl\u00e4che dringen kann.",
                    "Seine Genoss:innen haben das nicht h\u00f6ren wollen. Am 1. Mai 1984 trat Hurwitz aus dem Parlament zur\u00fcck und aus der Partei aus. Zur Aussprache, die ihm die SP Z\u00fcrich vor beinahe 40 Jahren versprach, ist es nie gekommen. Doch seit 2019 definiert die SP Schweiz f\u00fcr sich und ihre Gremien Antisemitismus nach der IHRA-Definition, die israelbezogene Formen von Antisemitismus explizit miteinschliesst. Gegen\u00fcber swissinfo.ch sagte Hurwitz, dass ihm diese sp\u00e4te Einsicht seiner Ex-Genoss:innen schon etwas bedeute. Im Februar ist er 86j\u00e4hrig verstorben.",
                    "Berthold Rothschild verband mit Emanuel Hurwitz eine lange Freundschaft. Rothschild politisierte in den 1980ern in der kommunistischen Partei der Arbeit (PdA). Lange habe bei den Kommunist:innen Israel als \"heroische Nation in den Geburtswehen\" gegolten, erz\u00e4hlt Rothschild. \"Genauso pl\u00f6tzlich drehte es dann.\"\u00a0Bevor er \u2013 zu \u00e4hnlicher Zeit wie Hurwitz \u2013 aus der PdA ausgetreten ist, habe er immer mal wieder erlebt, wie unter Kommunist:innen Stereotypen auftraten, etwa, dass J\u00fcd:innen die Linke im Zweifelsfall verraten w\u00fcrden.",
                    "Rothschild betont das Dilemma, das er bis heute in Bezug auf Israel/Pal\u00e4stina empfindet: Er habe sehr gute Freund:innen, die gegen\u00fcber dem Judenhass von Hizbollah oder Hammas lange blind waren. Er habe um diese Freundschaften immer gerungen, sei aber bei manchen \u00c4usserungen schon abrupt aufgestanden und nachhause gegangen. Gleichzeitig verstehe er, dass die israelische Politik und ihr Umgang mit den Pal\u00e4stinenser:innen viele Linke emp\u00f6re \u2013 und die Emp\u00f6rung ja oft begr\u00fcndet sei.",

Damit einhergeht, dass man fanatisch antiisraelisch wird.\" Antiisraelisch heisse nicht antisemitisch. \"Aber es ist nicht weit davon entfernt.\" Antisemitismus, sagt Rothschild, sei in der Linken unaufgel\u00f6st, verleugnet, verdr\u00e4ngt.",
                    "Damit sie da nicht in antisemitische Chiffren fallen, m\u00fcssen sich diese Aktivist:innen extrem genau beobachten. \"So wie ich mir des Rassismus, den mir die Gesellschaft mitgibt, bewusst bin, hoffe ich, dass sich andere bewusst sind, dass sie antisemitische Z\u00fcge in sich tragen.\"",
                    "Manche befreundete Linke seien so reflektiert, dass sie Rothschild Flyer oder Polittexte zur Testlekt\u00fcre vorlegen: Transportiert der Text unbeabsichtigt antisemitische Stereotypen? Doch das sind eher Ausnahmen.",
                    "Laut dem stellvertretenden Leiter des Zentrums f\u00fcr J\u00fcdische Studien der Universit\u00e4t Basel, Erik Petry, muss die Linie von Fall zu Fall gezogen werden: \"Oft kommt eine toxische Mischung zusammen, die eben nicht auf einer Kritik an der Politik des Staates beruht, sondern auf der Annahme, dass es hier ein unmoralisches Verhalten gibt, das mit dem J\u00fcdischsein zu tun hat.\" Das erlebe Petry auf linker Seite oft.",
                    "Politische Gegner:innen heben gerne hervor, dass es auch einen linken Antisemitismus gibt. Die Historikerin Christina Sp\u00e4ti beobachtet Versuche mancher \"rechter\" Politiker:innen sich so vom eigenen Antisemitismus \"reinzuwaschen\". Das bedeute aber nicht, dass es den linken Antisemitismus nicht wirklich gebe, sagt die Professorin an der Universit\u00e4t Fribourg und der FernUni Schweiz.",

                    "So erschien etwa in der sozialdemokratischen Presse 1970 ein Kommentar, der die Entf\u00fchrung Adolf Eichmanns durch Israel als \"Schlag ins Gesicht Argentiniens\" geisselte. Die gr\u00f6sste linke Zeitung der Schweiz verglich die israelische Politik in den 1980er-Jahren mehrfach mit der Politik der \"Endl\u00f6sung\" \u2013\u00a0dem Naziwort f\u00fcr die Ausl\u00f6schung der J\u00fcd:innen in Europa.",
                    "Sp\u00e4ti liefert unz\u00e4hlige weitere Beispiele. Immerhin der Kommentar zu Eichmanns Entf\u00fchrung hat beim Erscheinen 1970 zu einem Aufschrei gef\u00fchrt. Zu grotesk war der Antisemitismus in dem Artikel. Die subtileren Vorf\u00e4lle erfuhren keine vergleichbare Reaktion. Sp\u00e4ti kommt zum Fazit, es gebe eine \"Kontinuit\u00e4t der linken Indifferenz gegen\u00fcber Antisemitismus\". W\u00e4hrend in Deutschland in den 1990ern eine Reflexion startete, sei es in der Schweiz ein Tabu geblieben, erz\u00e4hlt sie im Gespr\u00e4ch mit swissinfo.ch.",
                    "Doch in den letzten Jahren nimmt Sp\u00e4ti innerhalb linker Kreise ein wachsendes Bed\u00fcrfnis wahr, sich mit Antisemitismus im eigenen Umfeld auseinanderzusetzen. Eine linke Aktivistin gegen Antisemitismus hat swissinfo.ch geschildert, wie ihr in den 1990er-Jahren bei Aufkl\u00e4rungsveranstaltungen zum Thema in Z\u00fcrich, andere Linke,\u00a0M\u00e4nner, mit einem \"Schuss ins Knie\" gedroht haben. Anfang 2000er l\u00f6sten ein Text und eine Karikatur auf der Plattform Indymedia eine innerlinke Debatte und eine Strafanzeige aus. Die Betreiber:innen von Indymedia Schweiz fanden den Text selbst antisemitisch, wollten ihn aber nicht l\u00f6schen.",
                    "In dieser \"Psychodynamik der Eskalation\" seien Freundschaften zerbrochen, schrieb dazu die linke \"Wochenzeitung\". Diese zitierte damals auch einen Verantwortlichen, der behauptete, \"Rassismus\" lasse sich \"grunds\u00e4tzlich nicht mit staatlichen Mitteln\", wie etwa der Antirassismus-Strafnorm, \"bek\u00e4mpfen\". Eine Position, die in der Schweizer Linken 20 Jahre danach wohl kaum mehr jemand \u00f6ffentlich \u00e4ussern w\u00fcrde. Die feministischen und antirassistischen Bewegungen der letzten Jahre haben breit f\u00fcr Diskriminierungsthemen sensibilisiert.",
                    "Trotzdem sp\u00fcren junge, j\u00fcdisch gelesene Linke, bis heute wie antisemitische Muster innerhalb ihres Umfelds an die Oberfl\u00e4che dringen. Anna Rosenwasser labelt sich als \"halb so j\u00fcdisch wie ihr Name klingt\". Darauf angesprochen, sagt die 32-J\u00e4hrige: \"Von Antisemitismus bin ich aber nicht halb betroffen.\" Auf Instagram, wo sie etwa Abstimmungsthemen erkl\u00e4rt und sich zu queeren und feministischen Themen positioniert, folgen ihr 25'000 Menschen.",
                    "Den Antisemitismus, den sie ausserhalb der Linken erlebt, empfindet Rosenwasser als bedrohlicher. Doch Linke stellen h\u00f6here Anspr\u00fcche an sich: \"Dass es in der Linken einen bewussten Umgang mit Antisemitismus braucht, ist f\u00fcr mich klar. In unserer Gesellschaft sind antisemitische Denkmuster verbreitet. Sie zu kennen und zu reflektieren, sehe ich als wichtige antifaschistische Aufgabe.\"",
                    "Dina Wyler sagt, viele Menschen seien \u00fcberzeugt, dass J\u00fcd:innen privilegiert seien und deshalb gar nicht diskriminiert werden k\u00f6nnen. \"Gerade von Linken wird ihnen die Diskriminierungserfahrung oft abgesprochen.\u201c",

                    "Die Begriffe zielen manchmal auf alle fr\u00fchen Zionist:innen, aber meist auf Theodor Herzl. Am 29. August 1897 rief er nach Basel zum ersten Zionistenkongress. Herzl war Initiator und dann Gr\u00fcndungspr\u00e4sident der World Zionist Organisation. \"Wenn ihr wollt, ist es kein Traum\", schrieb er danach: Ein j\u00fcdischer Staat, der j\u00fcdische Menschen vor antisemitischer Verfolgung und Diskriminierung sch\u00fctzt.",

Dabei ist das Land ja l\u00e4ngst real: Der Staat Israel feiert n\u00e4chstes Jahr seinen 75. Geburtstag. Angekommen ist das Land auch in der Realit\u00e4t, in den Widerspr\u00fcchen und Niederungen des Alltags. Doch Herzls Traum endete nicht bei der Staatsgr\u00fcndung.",
                    "Mit dem Motto \"Der Vergangenheit gedenken und eine Vision f\u00fcr die Zukunft errichten\", begr\u00fcsst die Moderatorin das Publikum am Sonntag. Die zweit\u00e4gige Konferenz gleicht phasenweise einem TED-Talk-Event: Da gibt es ausgefeilte Reden, die eine pers\u00f6nliche Geschichte mit grossen Ideen verbinden. Doch selbst bei Podiumsdiskussionen gibt es keinen Raum f\u00fcr Fragen aus dem Publikum.",
                    "Das f\u00fchrt dazu, dass m\u00f6gliche Widerspr\u00fcche zumindest im Plenum nicht diskutiert werden. Das Gedenken ist einhellig. Es wird an die 2000 Jahre Exil\u00a0bis hin zur Vernichtung von sechs Millionen J\u00fcdinnen und Juden in der Shoa erinnert. Ebenso betonen viele ihre Besorgnis \u00fcber die globale Zunahme von antisemitischen Attacken und bekr\u00e4ftigen ein entschiedenes Vorgehen dagegen.",
                    "Doch bei der Vision f\u00fcr die Zukunft gibt es Differenzen: Wenn etwa Yaakov Hagoel, Vorsitzender der World Zionist Organization, verk\u00fcndet, dass innert zehn Jahren die Mehrheit der J\u00fcd:innen weltweit in Israel leben solle, fragt sich, ob das auch im Sinn der j\u00fcdischen Diaspora sein kann. Von den weltweit 15 Millionen J\u00fcd:innen leben heute ausserhalb von Israel die meisten in den USA.",
                    "Nachman\u00a0Shai, Israels Minister f\u00fcr Diaspora-Anliegen, legt den Fokus eher auf Teilhabe. Er skizziert in Basel den Plan, dass Israel den Juden und J\u00fcdinnen weltweit eine M\u00f6glichkeit zur politischen Mitwirkung in Israel bieten soll.",
                    "Rabbi Azman ist mit dem Zug nach Basel gekommen \u2013 weil es aus der Ukraine keine Fl\u00fcge gibt. \"F\u00fcr Juden, die nichts haben, bedeutet Israel alles\", sagt der Chefrabbi der Ukraine zum Jubil\u00e4um. F\u00fcr jene, die jetzt fl\u00fcchten, hat die \"Alija\"\u00a0\u2013 das ist die M\u00f6glichkeit aller Juden und J\u00fcdinnen, nach Israel einzuwandern \u2013 eine grosse Bedeutung.",
                    "Azman illustriert sie am eigenen Beispiel. Vor \u00fcber 30 Jahren verliess er mit seiner Frau die auseinanderfallende Sowjetunion. Als sie in Wien auf ihren Anschlussflug warteten, habe seine hochschwangere Frau von einem Unterst\u00fctzer sogar eine Ananas bekommen, die sie sich sehnlichst gew\u00fcnscht hatte.",
                    "Die Idee der \"Alija\"\u00a0ist \u00e4lter als der politische Zionismus, aber entscheidend f\u00fcr ihn. Zionist:innen sind \u00fcberzeugt, dass die politische und gesellschaftliche Emanzipation ohne j\u00fcdischen Staat keine Sicherheit garantiert. \"Im 19. Jahrhundert glaubten optimistische j\u00fcdische Denker, dass die 'Judenfrage', Antisemitismus, die Diskriminierung durch Emanzipation verschwinden werde\", setzt der israelische Erfolgs-Autor Micah Goodman in seiner Rede an.",

                "content": [
                    "Wann h\u00f6rt ein Provisorium auf, ein Provisorium zu sein? Seit 74 Jahren unterst\u00fctzt das Uno-Hilfswerk UNRWA Pal\u00e4stina-Fl\u00fcchtlinge im Nahen Osten. Finanzielle Schwierigkeiten begleiteten diese Institution dabei st\u00e4ndig. Seit ungef\u00e4hr 2010 hat sich die Situation aber kontinuierlich zugespitzt, da mehrere Geldgeber ihre Beitr\u00e4ge senkten. Ein grosses Loch verursachte insbesondere die zeitweilige Aussetzung der amerikanischen Finanzierung unter dem Ex-Pr\u00e4sidenten Donald Trump 2018, die unter seinem Nachfolger wieder aufgenommen wurde.",
                    "Es klaffe eine L\u00fccke zwischen dem, was von der Organisation erwartet werde, und den Mitteln, die man ihr daf\u00fcr zur Verf\u00fcgung stelle, sagt deren Leiter Philippe Lazzarini. Er hat die Finanzierung der Agentur weit oben auf seiner Priorit\u00e4tenliste, dazu geh\u00f6rt auch \u00d6ffentlichkeitsarbeit. Drastisch warnt Lazzarini: \"Diese wachsende Diskrepanz zwischen Erwartungen und Mitteln k\u00f6nnte zu einer Implosion der Organisation f\u00fchren.\"",
                    "Es w\u00e4re ein Untergang mit Ansage. Die gesprochenen Beitr\u00e4ge stagnieren seit mehr als einem Jahrzehnt \u2013 ein Jahrzehnt, das der Region mehrere Krisen brachte: Der Krieg in Syrien, der Kollaps des Libanon, die Corona-Pandemie, zuletzt das Erdbeben und die erneute Zunahme von t\u00f6dlicher Gewalt in Israel und Pal\u00e4stina. Diese haben die bei der UNRWA registrierten pal\u00e4stinensischen Fl\u00fcchtlinge wiederholt getroffen, und oft ist die Organisation das einzige Auffangbecken f\u00fcr sie. Ohne zus\u00e4tzliche Mittel k\u00f6nne man aber auf die steigenden Bed\u00fcrfnisse nicht reagieren. \"Der Status quo ist schlicht nicht mehr tragbar\", sagt Lazzarini.",
                    "Die UNRWA, das Hilfswerk der Vereinten Nationen f\u00fcr Pal\u00e4stina-Fl\u00fcchtlinge im Nahen Osten, war einst als tempor\u00e4re Organisation gegr\u00fcndet worden, um pal\u00e4stinensische Fl\u00fcchtlinge nach 1948 zu versorgen. Seither wird das Mandat alle drei Jahre verl\u00e4ngert. L\u00e4ngst ist daraus eine Institution entstanden, die staatliche Aufgaben erledigt \u2013 so bietet sie etwa medizinische Versorgung, Bildung und\u00a0Erziehung sowie\u00a0humanit\u00e4re Massnahmen an. Dies f\u00fcr eine registrierte Bev\u00f6lkerung von 5,6 Millionen Menschen in Jordanien, Syrien, dem Libanon und den pal\u00e4stinensischen Autonomiegebieten, die je nach politischer Grosswetterlage in unterschiedlichem Masse darauf angewiesen ist.",
                    "Darunter befinden sich zurzeit 550'000 Sch\u00fcler:innen, jeweils zwei Millionen Menschen sind auf medizinische Erstversorgung oder Nahrungsmittelhilfe angewiesen. Das Spezielle daran: Die rund 30'000 Mitarbeitenden der UNRWA sind gr\u00f6sstenteils selber Pal\u00e4stinenser:innen. Und die Organisation hat nicht nur zunehmend M\u00fche, ihre Hilfsdienste aufrechtzuerhalten, sondern auch deren L\u00f6hne auszuzahlen.",
                    "Da der Fl\u00fcchtlingsstatus vererbt wird, w\u00e4chst die Zahl der Fl\u00fcchtlinge kontinuierlich \u2013 und damit auch die Anforderungen an die UNRWA. Finanziert wird all das \u00fcber freiwillige Spenden. Der Grossteil des Budgets, im Jahr 2022 waren es 1,6 Milliarden Dollar, kommt von westlichen Staaten. Die Schweiz beteiligt sich seit langem mit rund 20 Millionen Franken j\u00e4hrlich.",
                    "Augenf\u00e4llig ist die geringe Beteiligung arabischer Staaten, die zudem in den letzten Jahren abgenommen hat. \"Man sieht eine Diskrepanz: Es wird viel Solidarit\u00e4t mit der pal\u00e4stinensischen Bev\u00f6lkerung ausgedr\u00fcckt, aber gleichzeitig werden immer weniger Mittel gesprochen\", sagt Lazzarini. Das ist Ausdruck der geopolitischen Verschiebungen in der Region: Manche arabischen Staaten wollen ihr Verh\u00e4ltnis zu Israel normalisieren, die schwindende Unterst\u00fctzung der pal\u00e4stinensischen Fl\u00fcchtlinge ist eine Konsequenz davon.",
                    "F\u00fcr die Pal\u00e4stina-Fl\u00fcchtlinge, die in zunehmend schwierigeren Umst\u00e4nden \u00fcberleben m\u00fcssten, habe das nicht nur finanzielle Konsequenzen, sagt Lazzarini: \"Es macht sich vermehrt das Gef\u00fchl breit, von der internationalen Gemeinschaft vergessen worden zu sein.\" Gepaart mit der weit verbreiteten Armut und Perspektivlosigkeit eine gef\u00e4hrliche Mischung.",
                    "Auch die Kritik an der UNRWA hatte in den letzten Jahren zugenommen. Es gab Vorw\u00fcrfe wegen Missmanagement und antisemitischen Inhalten in Schulb\u00fcchern. So sagte der Schweizer Aussenminister Ignazio Cassis nach einem Besuch in einem Lager in Jordanien 2018, die UNRWA sei zu einem \"Teil des Problems\" geworden \u2013 die Organisation sei also bei der L\u00f6sung der Pal\u00e4stinenserfrage ein Hindernis. Ein Narrativ, das insbesondere rechte Gruppierungen in Israel und den USA bereits l\u00e4nger verbreiten.",
                    "Der Vorg\u00e4nger von Lazzarini, der Schweizer Diplomat Pierre Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, musste 2019 seinen Hut nehmen, nachdem er wegen Managementproblemen stark kritisiert wurde. Auch das hatte zu Staus in den Spendenfl\u00fcssen gef\u00fchrt. Europ\u00e4ische Staaten, darunter auch die Schweiz, hatten ihre Zahlungen suspendiert.",
                    "Man nehme Kritik ernst, sagt Lazzarini und verweist auf interne Umstrukturierungen und rigorose Kontrollen des Schulmaterials, das von den Beh\u00f6rden des jeweiligen Einsatzgebiets bereitgestellt wird. \"Aber die UNRWA wird oft f\u00fcr die Probleme in der Region verantwortlich gemacht. Diese k\u00f6nnen jedoch nur auf politischer Ebene gel\u00f6st werden \u2013 und daf\u00fcr gibt es leider schon l\u00e4nger keine Anzeichen\", so Lazzarini.",
                    "Durch die Weiterf\u00fchrung des Fl\u00fcchtlingsstatus und dem Festhalten an das R\u00fcckkehrrecht w\u00fcrden Friedensverhandlungen verunm\u00f6glicht, ist eine oft angebrachte Kritik. Stattdessen solle mehr in die Integration der Fl\u00fcchtlinge im jeweiligen Land investiert werden. \"Die Voraussetzungen dazu gibt es jedoch in keinem dieser L\u00e4nder\", sagt der Leiter des Hilfswerks.",
                    "Unrealistische Erwartungen im Zusammenhang mit der Organisation sind auch Ausdruck der starken Politisierung des Themas. N\u00fcchterne Fehleranalysen und eine Reformierung der Organisation werden teilweise dadurch verunm\u00f6glicht, dass alles durch eine Entweder-oder-Brille gesehen wird: Der Vorwurf einseitig pro-pal\u00e4stinensisch, respektive pro-israelisch zu sein, ist schnell zur Hand.",
                    "Im Jahr 2024 feiert die UNRWA ihr 75-j\u00e4hriges Bestehen. Wie wenig sich manche Dinge ver\u00e4ndert haben, erl\u00e4utert Lazzarini anhand eines k\u00fcrzlichen Besuchs eines Fl\u00fcchtlingslagers in Beirut: \"Nach einem Dreivierteljahrhundert verteilen Sie immer noch Essen\", habe sich ein junger Bewohner an ihn gerichtet.",
                    "Wie also weiter? \"Unser Ziel ist klar: Wir m\u00f6chten eine Situation, in der es die UNRWA nicht mehr braucht\", sagt Lazzarini. Da das Mandat der UNRWA auf Beschl\u00fcssen der Uno-Generalversammlung basiert, kann jede \u00c4nderung der Situation der pal\u00e4stinensischen Fl\u00fcchtlinge nur \u00fcber einen politischen Prozess eingeleitet werden. F\u00fcr den Moment bleibt ihm also nichts anderes \u00fcbrig, als die L\u00fccken zu schliessen und Wege zu finden, die Finanzierung der UNRWA mittelfristig zu stabilisieren.",
                    "Bis eine politische L\u00f6sung gefunden wird, bleibt aber die Organisation unersetzlich, da seien sich alle Akteure einig, sagt Lazzarini. Zumindest aus Israel klingt das anders, auch wenn er die Beziehungen zu den israelischen Beh\u00f6rden als pragmatisch bezeichnet und ein Kollaps der Organisation kaum in deren Interesse sein kann. \"Zurzeit ist in der Region viel in Bewegung. Wir m\u00fcssen optimistisch bleiben, dass eine L\u00f6sung gefunden werden kann \u2013 das sind wir den Pal\u00e4stina-Fl\u00fcchtlingen schuldig.\" Das bedeutet aber auch: Das Provisorium wird auf absehbare Zeit bleiben.",

                    "Bei SWI swissinfo.ch in Bern arbeiten Menschen aus 15 Nationen. Unsere\u00a0Journalist:innen mit internationalem Hintergrund befassen sich Tag f\u00fcr Tag mit der Schweiz, leben oft seit Jahrzehnten im Land, aber sie verfolgen auch das Geschehen in den L\u00e4ndern, in denen sie aufgewachsen sind.",
                    "Hier erz\u00e4hlen sechs\u00a0von ihnen, was die Wahlen in der Schweiz besonders spannend macht, wenn man dabei ein anderes Land im Hinterkopf beh\u00e4lt:\u00a0Japan, die USA, Tunesien, Russland, China oder\u00a0Mexiko.",
                    "Alle vier Jahre finden in der Schweiz nationale Wahlen statt. Die internationalen Medien schenken ihnen wenig Aufmerksamkeit, weil die politischen Verschiebungen in der stabilen Schweiz meist klein sind. Sollten die Schweizer Wahlen mehr Beachtung bekommen?",
                    "\"Die Instrumente der direkten Demokratie nehmen uns Gesetzgebern Macht weg, denn wir wissen, dass das Volk das letzte Wort hat. So pulverisieren wir die Macht in der Schweiz\", hat ein Schweizer Parlamentarier geantwortet, als zwei mexikanische Journalist:innen und ich vor einer Weile fragten, wie das politische System der Schweiz funktioniert.",
                    "In der Tat sind gute Wahlresultate in der Schweiz kein blindes Vertrauensvotum f\u00fcr die neue Regierung nach den Parlamentswahlen.",
                    "Das Vetorecht der B\u00fcrger:innen gegen die Entscheidungen der Legislative ist eine Konstante: Die regelm\u00e4ssigen Volksabstimmungen \u00fcber Initiativen und Referenden erm\u00f6glicht es den B\u00fcrger:innen, sich zu Entscheiden des Bundesparlaments zu \u00e4ussern oder Verfassungs\u00e4nderungen vorzuschlagen.",
                    "Ich komme aus Mexiko. Vor \u00fcber 25 Jahren habe ich mich bei mexikanischen Medienh\u00e4usern gemeldet, weil ich als Korrespondentin aus der Schweiz berichten wollte. \"Die Politik in der Schweiz ist langweilig\", erhielt ich zur Antwort.",
                    "Eine Frage der Perspektive: Es ist wahr, dass sich die Schweizer Wahlen nicht auf einen Machtkampf zwischen zwei, drei Figuren zuspitzen lassen. Aber das ist auch einer der Gr\u00fcnde, der das Schweizer System f\u00fcr eine Analyse interessant macht: Die Pr\u00e4sidentin oder der Pr\u00e4sident hat in der Schweiz \u2013 anders als in Mexiko \u2013 wenig Bedeutung.",
                    "Nach den Schweizer Wahlen w\u00e4hlt das Parlament die Landesregierung. Es ist ein Kollegium aus sieben Mitgliedern, die den st\u00e4rksten Parteien entstammen. Das zeigt: Die Schweiz legt viel Wert auf Konsens und die politische Macht ist auf mehrere Schultern verteilt.",
                    "Dies ist vielleicht auch der Grund, warum nicht mal in der Schweiz alle die Namen der Regierungsmitglieder kennen und oft gerade nicht wissen, wer Pr\u00e4sident:in ist. Denn der Bundespr\u00e4sident oder die Bundespr\u00e4sidentin rotiert in der Schweiz zwischen den Regierungsmitgliedern, es ist vor allem ein repr\u00e4sentativer Posten.",
                    "Auch das ist ein wichtiges Signal der geteilten politischen Macht, die das Schweizer System so anders macht, als in L\u00e4ndern wie Mexiko \u2013 wo die Politik mehr einer Telenovela gleicht.",
                    "\u00a0",
                    "Die Schweiz ist ein kleines und bescheidenes Land. Hier glaubt man, dass die Demokratie in der Eidgenossenschaft eine so komplizierte Sache ist, dass man sie Ausl\u00e4nder:innen ohnehin nicht erkl\u00e4ren kann.",
                    "Daher ergibt sich ein Paradoxon: Parlamentswahlen in der Schweiz \u2013\u00a0einem Land im Zentrum Europas, einem f\u00fchrenden Land in Bezug auf die wirtschaftliche Globalisierung, einem Land, das die Rolle des Finanz- und Bankenzentrums der Welt spielt, einem Land, wo viele internationale Organisationen ihren Sitz haben, einem Land mit einem m\u00e4chtigen milit\u00e4risch-industriellen Komplex \u2013\u00a0finden in der Regel statt, ohne dass jemand davon Notiz nimmt, und die Namen der f\u00fchrenden Schweizer Politiker:innen sagen ausserhalb des Landes niemandem etwas!",
                    "Lassen Sie uns versuchen, daran etwas zu \u00e4ndern und gleichzeitig zu erkl\u00e4ren, warum das so ist: Die Instrumente der traditionellen repr\u00e4sentativen Demokratie in der Schweiz existieren parallel zu den Instrumenten der direkten Demokratie. Die Schweizer Parlamentswahlen bringen nicht viel Ver\u00e4nderung?",
                    "Das liegt daran, dass sich in der Schweiz nicht alle vier Jahre etwas \u00e4ndert, sondern buchst\u00e4blich jeden Tag. Das liegt an den regelm\u00e4ssig stattfindenden Abstimmungen auf allen Ebenen \u2013\u00a0Bund, Kantone und Gemeinden.",
                    "Die vielleicht wichtigste Schlussfolgerung lautet also: In der Schweiz, einem Land der direkten Demokratie, ist f\u00fcr die W\u00e4hler:innen nicht das Ergebnis einer Partei bei den Parlamentswahlen ausschlaggebend!",
                    "Vielmehr kommt es darauf an, wie diese Partei im Alltag zwischen den Wahlen auf allen Ebenen des f\u00f6deralistischen Systems arbeitet: auf kommunaler Ebene, auf kantonaler Ebene und auch auf Bundesebene.",
                    "Dank Volksinitiative und Referendum ist der Sieg bei den Parlamentswahlen in der Schweiz kein Freibrief f\u00fcr die n\u00e4chsten vier Jahren zu tun und zu lassen, was und wie man es will.",
                    "Am Tag nach den Wahlen sind die Parteien verpflichtet, dem Volk L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr ganz bestimmte Probleme zu pr\u00e4sentieren, indem sie sich mit Gesetzesentw\u00fcrfen und Initiativen an die W\u00e4hler:innen wenden.",
                    "Diese Initiativen werden dann einem Referendum unterzogen, und der Gewinner oder die Gewinnerin von gestern kann in dieser oder jener Frage eine herbe Niederlage erleiden.",
                    "Der Begriff \"silberne Demokratie\" ist in Japan schon lange aufgetaucht. Angesichts der \u00dcberalterung der Bev\u00f6lkerung und der geringen Wahlbeteiligung der jungen Menschen wird bei Wahlen die \"Politik der \u00c4lteren, von den \u00c4lteren und f\u00fcr die \u00c4lteren\" in den Vordergrund ger\u00fcckt, was es diesen \u00e4lteren Politiker:innen und Parteien erleichtert, zu gewinnen und ihre Politik umzusetzen.",
                    "Da die Kosten f\u00fcr die soziale Sicherheit die Staatsfinanzen belasten, werden Reformen, die die Ausgaben f\u00fcr \u00e4ltere Menschen senken, aufgeschoben, w\u00e4hrend nur die Steuern und Versicherungspr\u00e4mien f\u00fcr junge Menschen steigen. Junge Menschen haben keine Zukunftsperspektiven \u2013\u00a0und die Geburtenrate sinkt weiter. Ein Teufelskreis.",
                    "In der Schweiz nehme ich aus der Bev\u00f6lkerung\u00a0nur wenig Sorgen wahr, dass sich die Demokratie in diese Richtung entwickelt. Im diesj\u00e4hrigen Wahlkampf fordern die linken Sozialdemokrat:innen den Ausbau \u00f6ffentlicher Kinderbetreuung, w\u00e4hrend die gr\u00f6sste Partei, die Schweizerische Volkspartei, klar dagegen ist.",
                    "In den Umfragen zu den wichtigsten Themen landen \"Gesundheitspr\u00e4mien\", \"Einwanderung\" und \"Rentenreform\" auf den vorderen Pl\u00e4tzen. Die \"Familienpolitik\"\u00a0ist nicht einmal eine Option.",
                    "Was ist der Grund f\u00fcr dieses mangelnde Interesse an Familienpolitik? Ist die niedrige Geburtenrate nicht ein wichtiges Thema f\u00fcr die Schweiz, die gleichzeitig Einwanderer und Einwanderinnen\u00a0auf der Suche nach h\u00f6heren L\u00f6hnen, einem h\u00f6heren Lebensstandard und einem stabileren politischen und wirtschaftlichen Klima anzieht?",
                    "Ist es in der Schweiz, wo einzelne politische Themen in Volksabstimmungen entschieden werden, nicht wichtig, Politiker:innen ins Parlament zu schicken, die sich an den Bed\u00fcrfnissen junger Menschen orientieren? Diese Fragen bleiben offen.",
                    "Ich jedoch habe das Gef\u00fchl, es besteht die Gefahr, dass die Schweiz zu einer Silberdemokratie wird. Mit 19,2% im Jahr 2022 ist der Anteil der \u00e4lteren Menschen an der Gesamtbev\u00f6lkerung in der Schweiz niedriger als in Japan (29,1%).",
                    "Allerdings sind 26% der in der Schweiz lebenden Personen ab 18 Jahren Ausl\u00e4nder:innen, die kein Stimmrecht haben. Die \u00dcberalterung der eigentlichen W\u00e4hlerschaft ist also deutlich h\u00f6her. Sie liegt bei 23,1% und ist damit fast so hoch wie in Japan im Jahr 2010.",
                    "Kann die Schweizer Demokratie den Abstieg in die Silberdemokratie verhindern? Wenn ja, k\u00f6nnte sie ein weiteres gutes Modell f\u00fcr alle entwickelten L\u00e4nder sein, deren Gesellschaft \u00fcberaltert.",
                    "Ich werde noch immer nostalgisch, wenn ich daran denke, wie ich mit 22 zum ersten Mal ein Parlament w\u00e4hlen konnte! Es waren nicht die ersten Wahlen in meinem Land, Tunesien. Aber es waren die ersten freien, demokratischen und transparenten Wahlen.",
                    "Also tunkte ich meinen Finger freudig in die blaue Wahltinte und teilte das Foto davon in den Sozialen Medien. Es war nicht nur eine \u00dcbung in Politik, es war eine Feier!",
                    "Ich sp\u00fcrte das Gewicht dieses historischen Moments, als ich meinen Stimmzettel abgab und wusste, dass ich damit zu einem demokratischen Prozess beitrage, auf den sich die Hoffnungen von Generationen vor mir und die Hoffnungen meiner eigenen Generation richteten. Heute, wo ich in der Schweiz bin, m\u00f6chte ich unbedingt am demokratischen Prozess teilnehmen.",
                    "Ein Viertel der erwachsenen Schweizer Bev\u00f6lkerung, ich auch, darf bei Parlamentswahlen nicht mitbestimmen.",
                    "Die eidgen\u00f6ssischen Wahlen im Oktober 2023 r\u00fccken n\u00e4her und \u00a0",

                    " w\u00e4hlen und abstimmen.",
                    "Manche sagen vielleicht: Warum sollten sich Ausl\u00e4nder:innen \u00fcberhaupt f\u00fcr die Schweizer Wahlen interessieren? Abgesehen von der offensichtlichen Antwort, dass ich als Journalistin in der Schweiz arbeite, f\u00fchrt meine Antwort auf diese Frage \u00fcber die Landesgrenzen hinaus.",
                    "Die Wichtigkeit dieser Wahl und von allen, die noch kommen, ist sp\u00fcrbar in den Familien von Imigrant:innen, M\u00e4nnern und Frauen, wo auch immer sie sind. Die politische Ausrichtung der Schweiz, die im Parlament entschieden wird, kann die Zukunft dieser Familien pr\u00e4gen oder sogar das Schicksal von Tausenden von Menschen entscheiden \u2013 besonders\u00a0im Hinblick auf Themen wie Migration und internationale Zusammenarbeit.",
                    "Da liegt der Kern der globalen Bedeutung der Schweiz: Es geht nicht nur um die Innenpolitik, sondern auch um die Auswirkungen dieser Politik auf das Leben von Menschen im Ausland.",
                    "Obwohl ich gegenw\u00e4rtig nicht w\u00e4hlen darf, verfolge ich die bevorstehenden Wahlen wach und genau. Heute, wo ich ausserhalb dieser demokratischen Arena stehe, tue ich das, was die Ausgeschlossenen oft tun\u2026 Ich n\u00e4hre die Hoffnung, eines Tages an diesem demokratischen Tanz teilzunehmen.",

                    "Bereits in der Pr\u00e4ambel der chinesischen Verfassung nimmt die Kommunistische Partei der Volksrepublik China (KPC) einen prominenteren Platz ein als \"Gott der Allm\u00e4chtige\"\u00a0in der Pr\u00e4ambel der Schweizer Bundesverfassung.",

                    "Das Amt des Generalsekret\u00e4rs der KPC ist das absolute Machtzentrum in China, w\u00e4hrend die Macht von Generalsekret\u00e4r:innen und Pr\u00e4sident:innen der Schweizer Parteien von ihrer \u00dcberzeugungskraft bei Wahlen abh\u00e4ngt.

Wenn niemand seine Meinung \u00e4ussert, darf man sich nachher nicht beschweren.\"",
                    "Die beiden Regensdorferinnen besch\u00e4ftigt jedoch nicht nur die tiefe Stimmbeteiligung, sondern sie nehmen gesamthaft ein schwindendes Interesse daran wahr, sich f\u00fcr die Gesellschaft zu engagieren. Die, die es machen, seien in Regensdorf immer dieselben, sagt Casanova. Steinmann: \"Ich glaube, das ist am Ende des Tages das Gleiche, wie es im Vereinswesen passiert.\"",
                    "Lange war sie die Pr\u00e4sidentin der Frauenturngruppe im Ort, doch eine Nachfolge zu finden war schwierig. \"Nur schon, wenn es darum geht, wer das Protokoll schreiben soll, schauen alle zu Boden. Alle wollen profitieren, doch wenn es darum geht, etwas beizutragen, haben pl\u00f6tzlich alle offene Schn\u00fcrsenkel!\"",
                    "Casonova res\u00fcmiert: \"Niemand will sich mehr in Vereinen oder ehrenamtlich einsetzen.\" Es gibt in Regensdorf fast 90 Vereine \u2013 dass so gut wie alle mit Nachwuchsproblemen k\u00e4mpfen, sei ein schlechtes Zeichen.",
                    "Ein Geheimrezept f\u00fcr mehr Engagement \u2013\u00a0sei es politisch oder gesellschaftlich \u2013\u00a0kennen die beiden Frauen nicht, aber sie sehen Potenzial. \"Im Ortsteil Watt gibt es im Wahllokal ein Abstimmungscaf\u00e9, das vom Kulturverein Watt betrieben wird. Das motiviert die Stimmb\u00fcrger und man kann sich untereinander austauschen\", sagt Casanova und erg\u00e4nzt: \"Im Gegenteil dazu scheint die M\u00f6glichkeit zur Abstimmung per App eher nicht anspornend zu sein.\"",
                    "Zudem, da sind sich Casanova und Steinmann einig, verbringen die Jungen ja ohnehin schon viel zu viel Zeit vor dem Handy oder dem Computer \u2013\u00a0Zeit, die man in anderes investieren k\u00f6nnte, sei es in einen Verein, in politisches Engagement oder in Nachbarschaftshilfe.",
                    "Bevor sich die beiden Frauen an die Auswertung der eingesammelten Stimmen machen, bleibt noch Zeit f\u00fcr eine schnelle politische Prognose: \"Wenn es so kommt, wie ich es ausgef\u00fcllt habe, w\u00e4re es bunt gemischt\", sagt Rosmarie Steinmann diplomatisch. Anita Casanova prognostiziert dagegen einen leichten Rechtsrutsch.",
                    "Am Abend ist klar: Steinmann und Casanova behalten doppelt recht. Es kommt zu einem leichten Rechtsrutsch \u2013 und die Stimmbeteiligung ist tief. In Regensdorf hat nur etwa jede vierte stimmberechtigte Person an der Abstimmung teilgenommen, im ganzen Kanton Z\u00fcrich waren es auch nur knapp 35%.",
                    "Doch das Engagement von Menschen wie Steinmann und Casanova h\u00e4lt\u00a0das Getriebe der Demokratie am Laufen.",
                    "In der Schweiz werden mehr als 80% der Stimmen vor dem eigentlichen Wahltag per Post abgegeben. In den meisten Kantonen muss dazu der sogenannte \"Stimmrechtsausweis\" unterschrieben werden, der mit dem in einem Couvert verschlossenen Abstimmungs- oder Wahlentscheid abgegeben wird. Beim Stimmen z\u00e4hlen wird als erstes kontrolliert, ob die Unterschrift auf dem Stimmrechtsausweis vorhanden ist. Fehlt sie, ist die Stimme ung\u00fcltig.",
                    "Beim W\u00e4hlen ist es dagegen komplizierter, denn einerseits k\u00f6nnen Stimmberechtigte einfach die Liste einer Partei einwerfen, andererseits k\u00f6nnen sie die Namen auf der Liste nach Belieben kombinieren.\u00a0Die unver\u00e4nderten werden von Hand ausgez\u00e4hlt \u2013 von mehreren Personen, um Fehler zu vermeiden. Bei den ver\u00e4nderten Wahlzetteln gibt es einen zus\u00e4tzlichen Zwischenschritt, weil kontrolliert werden muss, ob die Anpassungen beim Ver\u00e4ndern korrekt gemacht worden sind.",
                    "Die Kantone Basel-Stadt und Genf, sowie weitere St\u00e4dte und D\u00f6rfer, setzen mittlerweile auf maschinenlesbare Stimmzettel, die das Kreuz auf dem Zettel automatisch erfassen.\u00a0Andere, etwa das Dorf Maur im Kanton Z\u00fcrich, setzen bei Abstimmungen auf Pr\u00e4zisionswaagen zum Ausz\u00e4hlen.",

                    "Die Schweizer Wahlen sind nicht bekannt f\u00fcr grosse Verschiebungen \u2013 die Dramatik muss man zuweilen mit der Lupe suchen. Seit Beginn des israelisch-pal\u00e4stinensischen Krieges hat sich das \u00f6ffentliche Interesse definitiv hin zur Weltlage verschoben. Die Berichterstattung \u00fcber die Schweizer Wahlen kam vielleicht aber auch ins Stottern, weil sich in den Wahlen 2023 anders als vor vier Jahren kein \u00fcberragendes Wahlkampfthema zeigte.",
                    "Die Plattform Ann\u00e9e Politique Suisse wertet in Wahl- und Abstimmungsk\u00e4mpfen auch die Zeitungsberichterstattung nach wissenschaftlichen Kriterien aus. Wie oft ist welche Partei erschienen? Welches Thema hat den Wahlkampf dominiert? In 4106 untersuchten Zeitungsartikeln w\u00e4hrend acht Wochen ergab sich ein breites Feld von Themen: \"Krankenkasse, Gesundheit\"\u00a0kam zwar am h\u00e4ufigsten vor, aber auch Banken, Verkehr, Energie, Migration und Klima seien als Themen pr\u00e4sent gewesen, schreiben die Autor:innen Anja Heidelberger und Marc B\u00fchlmann in der Analyse der Berichterstattung.",
                    "Anders also als bei den Wahlen 2019, die als \"Klimawahl\"\u00a0und \"Frauenwahl\" in Erinnerung bleiben und bei den Wahlen 2015, wo angesichts hoher Asylzahlen die Berichterstattung \u00fcber Migration alles dominierte, k\u00f6nne man 2023\u00a0\"eher nicht von einer vorwiegend monothematischen medialen Wahlkampfberichterstattung\" sprechen.",
                    "Die Schweizer Wahlen sind Mobilisierungswahlen. Die im internationalen Vergleich tiefe Wahlbeteiligung sorgt daf\u00fcr, dass sich die Wahlen vor allem dar\u00fcber entscheiden, welcher Partei es gelingt, ihre vorhandene Klientel zu mobilisieren. Marc B\u00fchlmann, Co-Autor der Studie und Direktor von Ann\u00e9e Politique Suisse erkl\u00e4rt das Zusammenspiel von Medien und Wahlkampf im Gespr\u00e4ch mit SWI swissinfo.ch: \"In der Schweiz mit ihrer tiefen Wahlbeteiligung ist in jedem Wahlkampf die Frage zentral, wer es schafft, seine Klientel zu mobilisieren. Als die Gr\u00fcnen vor vier Jahren von der Klimabewegung als Probleml\u00f6serin gesehen worden sind, hat das ihre W\u00e4hler:innen st\u00e4rker mobilisiert.\"",
                    "Nun sei es der Partei weniger gut gelungen, das weiterhin pr\u00e4sente Klimathema f\u00fcr sich zu nutzen. Denn wenn \u00fcber Klimapolitik berichtet wird, etwa im Zusammenhang mit Aktivist:innen, die sich auf eine Strasse kleben und so den Verkehr blockieren, helfe das der Gr\u00fcnen Partei nicht.",
                    "Die Politolog:innen von Ann\u00e9e Politique Suisse werten auch aus, wie oft die Parteien vorkommen. Die rechtskonservative SVP als st\u00e4rkste Partei wird am h\u00e4ufigsten erw\u00e4hnt. Es folgen die sozialdemokratische SP, die liberale FDP und die gem\u00e4ssigte Mitte-Partei.",
                    "Auffallend genau entspricht die H\u00e4ufigkeit der Berichterstattung den W\u00e4hlendenanteilen von 2019. Doch die vier Regierungsparteien sind im Verh\u00e4ltnis zu kleineren Parteien \u00fcbervertreten \u2013 am meisten untervertreten sind die kleinen Oppositionsparteien EVP, EDU, MCG, Lega: \"Ihr W\u00e4hlendenanteil von 10,1 Prozent steht einem Medienartikelanteil von 3,4 Prozent gegen\u00fcber\", heisst es in der Analyse.",
                    "Dass die Berichterstattung so gut zum W\u00e4hlendenanteil 2019 passt, ist f\u00fcr B\u00fchlmann bemerkenswert: \"Es bleibt erstaunlich, wie gut es die Printmedien insgesamt schaffen, die herrschenden Verh\u00e4ltnisse hinsichtlich W\u00e4hlendenst\u00e4rken abzubilden.\"",
                    "Die Parteien sind zwar auch auf den Sozialen Medien pr\u00e4sent, doch diese h\u00e4lt der Ann\u00e9e Politique-Direktor tendenziell f\u00fcr vernachl\u00e4ssigbar. \"Ein Grossteil der W\u00e4hlerinnen und W\u00e4hler sind Menschen mittleren Alters. Diese nutzen die Sozialen Medien nicht, um Informationen zu erlangen\", so B\u00fchlmann. Zwar anerkannt er, dass die Parteien die Sozialen Medien als Kan\u00e4le zur Mobilisierung nutzen. Doch: \"Es d\u00fcrfte im Moment eher schwierig sein, via diesen Kanal neue W\u00e4hlerinnen und W\u00e4hler zu gewinnen oder von sich zu \u00fcberzeugen.\"",
                    "Die Plattform \"Politransparency\" zeigt auf, dass die SP mit 429'100 Franken\u00a0am meisten f\u00fcr Werbung auf Facebook und Instagram investiert hat. Dahinter folgen die FDP,\u00a0die Mitte-Partei,\u00a0die Gr\u00fcnliberalen\u00a0und die Gr\u00fcnen.\u00a0Die SVP hat in diesem Feld nur 112'000\u00a0Franken investiert.",

Chiesa ist \u00fcberzeugt: \"Die vorausgesagten Resultate sind ein Auftrag an unsere Partei und an das ganze Parlament.\" Die Schweiz habe Probleme mit Migration, illegalen Migrant:innen, mit der grossen Zuwanderung und der Energieversorgung. \"Die W\u00e4hler:innen haben nun klipp und klar gesagt was sie wollen.\"",

Die Stromversorgungssicherheit, die Finanzierung der Altersvorsorge und unser Wohlstand seien in den n\u00e4chsten paar Jahren die entscheidenden Themen, h\u00e4tten im Wahlkampf jedoch nicht verfangen.",
                    "\"Klar ist: Migration war das grosse Thema\", so Burkart. Das zeichne sich nun auch im Wahlresultat der SVP ab.

Die FDP wolle auch die Hand ausstrecken in Richtung der b\u00fcrgerlichen Kolleg:innen im Bereich Asyl. Burkart bittet die SVP jedoch um Kompromissbereitschaft und die anderen Parteien darum, beim Thema Migration mitzuhelfen, L\u00f6sungen zu suchen. \"Denn das treibt die Bev\u00f6lkerung um.\"",

                    "Wie immer nach den Wahlen ist auch die sogenannte Zauberformel \u2013 die Zusammensetzung des Bundesrats \u2013 ein grosses Thema. Ein Thema, \u00fcber das die Parteipr\u00e4sident:innen nicht gerne zu sprechen scheinen.",
                    "Der Bundesrats-Traum scheint nach dem Wahlresultat der Gr\u00fcnen geplatzt. \"Rein arithmetisch ist der Anspruch auf einen Bundesratssitz immer noch legitim\", ist Gl\u00e4ttli \u00fcberzeugt. Aber nach diesem Resultat werde es politisch schwierig. Die Gr\u00fcnen w\u00fcrden in der Fraktion die Lage analysieren und einen allf\u00e4lligen Angriff auf einen Bundesratssitz noch besprechen.",
                    "F\u00fcr die GLP sei das auch kein Thema. Die Partei von J\u00fcrg Grossen habe das Ziel von 10% W\u00e4hler:innenanteil klar verfehlt. Dies und der Einzug in den St\u00e4nderat seien Kriterien gewesen f\u00fcr einen m\u00f6glichen Anspruch eines Bundesratssitzes. Klar sei jedoch: \"Die Zauberformel hat schon lange ausgezaubert, schon lange\", so Grossen.

Realizza una cifra d'affari annuale di circa 40 milioni di euro e impiega 170 persone.",
                    "In giugno, Tinamu e il suo personale di dieci persone hanno annunciato un aumento di capitale di un milione di franchi proseguire l'espansione. La start-up non ha dovuto aspettare Parrot per raggiungere i primi successi. Un po' grazie al caso, era gi\u00e0 riuscita a mettere il piede nella porta di uno dei giganti mondiali delle materie prime, Trafigura, il cui centro operativo si trova a Ginevra. \u00a0",
                    "\"Tramite la nostra rete, abbiamo sentito dire che Nyrstar, filiale di Trafigura, cercava una soluzione per fare l'inventario delle sue scorte\", racconta Libouton. Nyrstar, gruppo di fonderia e di commercio di metalli, \u00e8 tra i leader mondiali dello zinco e del piombo e tratta anche con il rame, l'oro e l'argento. La start-up elvetica ha presentato la sua soluzione nel deposito della multinazionale nel porto di Anversa ed \u00e8 stata approvata.",
                    "\"Abbiamo scelto il sistema di Tinamu per la sua velocit\u00e0 e la sua precisione\", conferma un portavoce di Nyrstar. L'impresa aveva testato altre soluzioni, come dei rilevamenti fotografici o radar, ma generavano troppi dati, difficili da elaborare rapidamente. \"Siccome la soluzione di Tinamu \u00e8 automatizzata, il nostro personale in loco non ha bisogno di imparare a pilotare dei droni e, dato che questi ultimi non dipendono dal GPS, possono operare all'interno di un deposito chiuso\", aggiunge il portavoce. Ci conferma inoltre che Nyrstar prevede di \"lavorare con Tinamu in altri siti nel mondo\".",
                    "E non \u00e8 tutto: ancor prima di siglare il contratto con la multinazionale, Tinamu aveva gi\u00e0 convinto \u2013 senza cercarlo \u2013 un peso massimo svizzero. Prima di andare a presentare il sistema ad Anversa, la start-up ha avuto bisogno di testarlo a grandezza reale. \"Ci siamo quindi recati da una societ\u00e0 di genio civile e materiali di costruzione vicino a Zurigo e la soluzione ha talmente impressionato che hanno detto: 'La vogliamo anche noi!'\", racconta Libouton.",
                    "La societ\u00e0 \u00e8 Kibag, uno dei leader svizzeri del settore. Nel suo sito di Regensdorf, vicino a Zurigo, ricicla ogni anno milioni di tonnellate di materiali provenienti da cantieri di demolizione per farne ghiaia per l'edilizia. Qui la gestione delle rimanenze \u00e8 indispensabile, in particolare per sapere quanto posto resta per immagazzinare nuovi materiali e quanto volume \u00e8 stato riciclato ed \u00e8 pronto a essere venduto.",
                    "\"Prima, la stima si faceva a occhio, poi si riportavano le cifre nelle tabelle excel. Era fastidioso, prendeva molto tempo e non era preciso. Avevamo sempre dei dubbi\", racconta Urs Fischer, che dirige il sito di Kibag a Regensdorf. Per lui e la sua squadra, il piccolo drone che fa tutto il lavoro automaticamente e invia dati precisi in tempo reale direttamente sugli schermi \u00e8 diventato rapidamente indispensabile, al punto che non immaginano pi\u00f9 come potrebbe funzionare la struttura senza di esso.",
                    "Nyrstar, Kibag: a questi grossi clienti si \u00e8 presto aggiunto quest'estate Axpo Tegra, nei Grigioni. Questa filiale del gigante energetico Axpo produce cippato di legno per centrali elettriche. Il sistema sviluppato da Tinamu ha potenziale anche nel settore della transizione energetica.",
                    "I materiali di cui fa l'inventario sono indispensabili, ad esempio, per le batterie delle automobili elettriche. L'approvvigionamento e il riciclo di questi metalli sono ormai classificati come \"critici\" e \"strategici\" e sono una grande preoccupazione dell'Unione europea. La loro circolazione si far\u00e0 secondo il sistema \"just-in-time\" (produrre e vendere solo ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 necessario e solo quando \u00e8 richiesto), da cui l'importanza della gestione delle scorte.",
                    "\"Il ruolo dei droni e la loro autonomia continuano a evolversi\", ci conferma Alcherio Martinoli, professore associato al Laboratorio di sistemi intelligenti distribuiti e algoritmi del Politecnico federale di Losanna (EPFL). Secondo lui, l'utilit\u00e0 dei droni non ha pi\u00f9 bisogno di essere dimostrata in ambito industriale e professionale. D'altronde, \"l'industria l'ha ben capito e continuer\u00e0 a sfruttare questa tecnologia che, oltre a offrire osservazioni migliori, permette anche di proteggere il personale\". Grazie a questi apparecchi, le personenon hanno pi\u00f9 sistematicamente bisogno di esporsi a situazioni o ambienti potenzialmente pericolosi.",
                    "I droni saranno anche sempre pi\u00f9 capaci di basarsi sui propri sensori invece che su una fonte esterna come il GPS per orientarsi, aggiunge il professore. \"Oggi dei nuovi recettori in fase di sviluppo hanno propriet\u00e0 interessanti, come le telecamere neuromorfiche (event camera) che forniscono solamente le informazioni essenziali al drone anzich\u00e9 tutti i dati contenuti in un'immagine classica\".",
                    "Tuttavia, ci sono ancora degli ostacoli da superare, avverte Martinoli: \"Utilizzare solo sensori incorporati richiede calcoli complessi e significa lavorare con molte incertezze\". In uno spazio condiviso tra umani e robot, l'automatizzazione dei compiti diventa pi\u00f9 difficile, perch\u00e9 l'ambiente \u00e8 pi\u00f9 dinamico, ma anche a causa di direttive di sicurezza molto pi\u00f9 severe.",
                    "Comunque sia, i droni sono in marcia - o piuttosto in volo - e molti ricercatori e ricercatrici lavorano per il loro impiego in luoghi come le imbarcazioni, le centrali eoliche, nucleari, i ponti o i monumenti storici.",

                    "Le due chiese si stanno preparando al fatto che la fuga dei fedeli finir\u00e0 per costituire un serio problema finanziario. Lo studio citato prevede un calo delle entrate di decine di milioni di franchi nei prossimi vent'anni. Oltre alla riduzione del numero di persone contribuenti che pagano l'imposta ecclesiastica (vedi riquadro), il documento prevede che le chiese avranno sempre pi\u00f9 difficolt\u00e0 a difendere la loro legittimit\u00e0 per riscuotere denaro pubblico se la loro influenza nella societ\u00e0 continuer\u00e0 a diminuire.",

                    "Esistono tante varianti quanti sono i Cantoni, ma la maggior parte di essi applica una tassa ecclesiastica. Questa tassa viene pagata dal singolo contribuente, che per esserne esentato deve presentare una richiesta ufficiale per uscire dalla Chiesa, il che significa che non possono pi\u00f9 partecipare alle funzioni.",
                    "In alcuni Cantoni, anche le persone giuridiche, cio\u00e8 le aziende, sono tenute a pagare l'imposta ecclesiastica, il che \u00e8 oggetto di dibattito.",

Finanziate esclusivamente da donazioni private, le chiese di questi due Cantoni sono le pi\u00f9 povere del Paese. I e le contribuenti possono decidere volontariamente se versare o meno l'imposta ecclesiastica.",

                    "Secondo la presidente della Conferenza centrale cattolica romana, che federa queste corporazioni, si tratta di un sistema unico al mondo che \"permette alla Chiesa cattolica in Svizzera di beneficiare di una maggiore trasparenza e di un migliore controllo\".",
                    "La Chiesa cattolica e quella protestante stanno quindi analizzando nuovi modelli per diversificare le loro fonti di reddito, sfruttando il loro patrimonio immobiliare, sponsorizzando o cofinanziando alcuni progetti o attraverso contratti di servizio. Le chiese hanno anche individuato l'importanza di comunicare meglio le loro attivit\u00e0 e l'uso dei fondi messi a loro disposizione.",
                    "\"Meno soldi significa chiese pi\u00f9 piccole, meno personale e meno servizi per il pubblico\", sottolinea J\u00f6rg Stolz.

Cosa c'\u00e8 dietro a questo fenomeno?",

                    "Nella cucina di famiglia, dove ronza la ventola sopra i fornelli, i bambini sono appena tornati a casa. \"Con loro parlo quasi esclusivamente italiano\", dice Elisa Malinverni, autrice e insegnante di yoga, nel pi\u00f9 tipico tedesco bernese. I suoi due figli rispondono sempre in tedesco. Oggi, per\u00f2, il figlio maggiore interviene: \"M\u00e4ngisch parleni o Italiano!\" (sic.)",
                    "In questa casa c'\u00e8 un variopinto tira e molla\u00a0tra italiano e tedesco bernese. Eppure, per Malinverni, ogni lingua ha una sua funzione. \"Da un lato, l'italiano \u00e8 per me la lingua degli slogan. Ha anche un che di seducente e posso dare libero sfogo alla Sophia Loren che \u00e8 in me. Ma l'italiano ha per me pure una certa austerit\u00e0, perch\u00e9 \u00e8 profondamente legato a mia madre, una figura molto autoritaria nella mia vita\".",
                    "Ci\u00f2 che nella casa dei genitori era ancora disapprovato, il passaggio dall'italiano al tedesco, ora questa madre lo usa consapevolmente come strumento nella vita quotidiana: \"Quando devo incitare i miei figli al mattino, passo al tedesco bernese. Cos\u00ec sono meno severa con loro che in italiano\".",
                    "\"Molte persone multilingue percepiscono un cambio di lingua e di personalit\u00e0\", afferma Jean-Marc Dewaele, professore di linguistica applicata alla Birkbeck University di Londra.",
                    "Cresciuto in Belgio, conosce il fenomeno per esperienza personale: \"Leggo e scrivo poesie quasi esclusivamente in francese. In famiglia parliamo molto olandese. Come accademico, invece, sono britannico: sia nella scelta delle parole che nell'atteggiamento\".",
                    "La tesi di Dewaele trova conferma in numerosi studi: in una ricerca in cui sono state interpellate 1'500 persone, l'80% di chi parla diverse lingue ha dichiarato di comportarsi in modo diverso a seconda della lingua. Secondo Dewaele, \u00e8 il risultato della \"risonanza emotiva\" delle lingue.",
                    "Un noto esperimento di psicologia morale rende tangibile questo fenomeno: cinque persone sono legate su un binario. Un treno si dirige verso di loro senza frenare. Solo voi avete la possibilit\u00e0 di fermare il treno spingendo una persona molto grossa da un ponte sul binario. \" \"Would you do that? Tu le ferais? W\u00fcrdest du das tun? W\u00fcrsch das mache? Lo faresti?\".",
                    "A seconda della lingua in cui vi viene presentato il dilemma morale, potreste giungere a una conclusione diversa. Questo \u00e8 il risultato di uno studio pubblicato nel 2014 dall'Universit\u00e0 Pompeu Fabra di Barcellona.",
                    "Nella propria lingua madre, l'80% delle persone interpellate ha deciso di non spingere l'uomo dal ponte. In inglese, la seconda lingua di chi ha partecipato, il rapporto \u00e8 cambiato: il numero di persone che ha detto che lo avrebbe fatto era il triplo e ha deciso secondo il principio pi\u00f9 utilitaristico.",
                    "Autori e autrici dello studio sono arrivati alla conclusione che la distanza psicologica e il pragmatismo sono maggiori nella seconda lingua rispetto alla prima. \"Le persone che hanno partecipato\u00a0hanno reagito pi\u00f9 emotivamente nella prima lingua e pi\u00f9 razionalmente nella seconda\", aggiunge Dewaele.",
                    "A seconda del contesto in cui si \u00e8 appresa una lingua, si associano pi\u00f9 o meno emozioni: \"Impariamo la nostra lingua madre o la prima lingua in un contesto familiare, che \u00e8 molto emotivo. Quando impariamo una lingua in classe, l'accesso linguistico al mondo emotivo spesso manca del tutto. Con la prima lingua, la risonanza emotiva \u00e8 molto grande, nel secondo caso \u00e8 piccola\".",
                    "Come l'autrice e insegnante di yoga Malinverni, le persone multilingue possono usare attivamente questo strumento. Ad esempio, pu\u00f2 essere utile pensare alle questioni finanziarie in una seconda lingua, pi\u00f9 razionale.",
                    "Il cambio di lingua \u00e8 uno strumento utile anche in psicoterapia, afferma Dewaele. \"I e le pazienti possono essere in grado di descrivere pi\u00f9 facilmente i traumi in una seconda lingua pi\u00f9 razionale. In una fase successiva, questi possono essere espressi nella prima lingua, anche se il terapeuta non la comprende\".",
                    "Le lingue, con la loro risonanza emotiva, possono quindi riecheggiare in\u00a0chi parla in modi diversi, come strumenti musicali. \"Penso che ci sia qualcosa di meraviglioso nel vivere il proprio io in modo diverso in lingue diverse\", riassume Malinverni. \"Si ha una lingua per quasi tutte le sfaccettature della propria personalit\u00e0\". Il linguista Dewaele aggiunge: una seconda lingua o una lingua straniera originale pu\u00f2 anche diventare una nuova lingua del cuore.",

L'ha fatto in nome della tregua olimpica, proclamata dall'Assemblea generale dell'ONU, che inizia due settimane prima dei Giochi e si conclude due settimane dopo la loro fine.

                    " dimostra che negli ultimi anni le raffinerie d'oro elvetiche hanno lavorato grandi quantit\u00e0 di oro di origine russa proveniente da Londra.\u00a0",
                    "Dal 2021, 110 tonnellate del metallo prezioso, per un valore di oltre sei miliardi di franchi, sono passate attraverso\u00a0fonderie situate nella Confederazione. Solo dall'inizio della guerra, nel febbraio 2022, sono giunte in Svizzera 75 tonnellate, secondo i dati dell'Ufficio federale della dogana e della sicurezza dei confini (UDSC).",
                    "Le statistiche mostrano un forte aumento delle importazioni di oro di origine russa in Svizzera. Prima della guerra, ogni anno la Confederazione ne importava in media solo circa 20 tonnellate. A titolo di paragone, solo nei primi cinque mesi di quest'anno, ne sono invece giunte 38 tonnellate, passando\u00a0da Londra.\u00a0",
                    "Il percorso dell'oro russo passa dal Regno Unito. Fino al 2018, il Paese vi esportava pochissimo oro. Poi, le quantit\u00e0 sono esplose: dal 2019 fino allo scoppio della guerra, la Russia ne ha venduto a Londra oltre 700 tonnellate, per un valore di oltre 34 miliardi di franchi, secondo le statistiche ufficiali britanniche\u00a0per il commercio estero.",
                    "L'esperto svizzero di metalli preziosi Bernhard Schnellmann spiega cos\u00ec l'aumento: \"La banca centrale russa ha smesso di acquistare oro a met\u00e0 2019 e poi ha soppresso l'IVA sull'oro\". Di conseguenza le esportazioni aurifere sono fortemente aumentate.\u00a0",
                    "L'ex professore di diritto penale ed esperto di commercio dell'oro Mark Pieth ha una spiegazione diversa. L'esperto ci vede un chiaro collegamento con l'invasione russa dell'Ucraina: \"Presumo che queste vendite servissero a preparare la guerra\", afferma.\u00a0",
                    "Per Pieth, quindi, c'\u00e8 il sospetto che la Russia possa aver riempito il suo forziere di guerra con massicce esportazioni di oro. Oltre alle entrate derivanti dalle vendite di gas e petrolio, l'oro potrebbe cos\u00ec aver contribuito a finanziare la guerra di aggressione all'Ucraina.\u00a0",
                    "Il fatto che questo oro sia stato presumibilmente lavorato anche in Svizzera \u00e8 problematico, secondo Pieth, anche se in questo momento il regime russo non starebbe traendo profitti dalle transazioni. \"Se ora le raffinerie svizzere importassero quest'oro e lo rifondessero, non sarebbe problematico dal profilo legale. Sarebbe per\u00f2 eticamente molto discutibile\", afferma Pieth.\u00a0",
                    "Anche Marc Ummel, esperto di materie prime presso l'ong Swissaid, sottolinea questo aspetto. Perch\u00e9 con la rifusione, \"l'oro russo eticamente discutibile\" diventa oro con il marchio di qualit\u00e0 svizzero. \"Si perde la tracciabilit\u00e0, il che \u00e8 molto problematico\", afferma.\u00a0",
                    "Le raffinerie d'oro in Svizzera non vedono alcun collegamento tra la lavorazione dell'oro di origine russa e le attivit\u00e0 belliche del Cremlino. Da noi contattato, Christoph Wild, presidente dell'Associazione svizzera dei fabbricanti e dei commercianti di metalli preziosi afferma che \"quest'oro non \u00e8 sottoposto a sanzioni e non ha nulla a che fare con l'etica. \u00c8 stato prodotto prima dell'inizio della guerra\".\u00a0",
                    "Finch\u00e9 si pu\u00f2 dimostrare che si tratta di oro esportato dalla Russia al Regno Unito prima della guerra e quindi dell'inizio delle sanzioni, Wild non vede alcun problema etico nella sua lavorazione. \"Non si tratta di una sparizione forzata dell'oro russo\", dice.\u00a0",
                    "In Svizzera vige il divieto di \"acquistare, importare o trasportare\" oro dalla Russia. Lo ha deciso il Consiglio federale nell'agosto del 2022.\u00a0",
                    "Per quanto riguarda l'oro di origine russa importato in Svizzera negli ultimi anni, l'UDSC afferma che \"\u00e8 tutto legale\" e che le importazioni sono state controllate. L'oro proviene originariamente dalla Russia, ma era gi\u00e0 stato esportato nel Regno Unito\u00a0prima dell'inizio della guerra in Ucraina nel febbraio 2022.

                    "La Confederazione \u00e8 stata sottoposta a pressioni da parte del G7, ma si trova anche in una posizione difficile perch\u00e9, in una certa misura, ha potere decisionale a Bruxelles. O meglio, non siede al tavolo di Bruxelles, ma costituzionalmente ha deciso che attuer\u00e0 qualsiasi decisione presa a Bruxelles in materia di sanzioni. Questo porta inevitabilmente a una discrepanza, poich\u00e9 potrebbe finire per dover attuare misure con cui non \u00e8 d'accordo.",
                    "Senza un registro sulle societ\u00e0 trasparente, la capacit\u00e0 di implementare le sanzioni si riduce in modo significativo. Come pu\u00f2 un Paese garantire che non ci sia un legame tra una persona sanzionata e una societ\u00e0 che opera nella sua giurisdizione se non dispone di tutte le informazioni? I media scopriranno velocemente che un legame c'\u00e8. Questo \u00e8 un servizio prezioso che l'industria mediatica ha svolto per diversi anni.",
                    "Penso che un buon registro delle societ\u00e0 - per citare un collega in Lettonia - sia la \"scialuppa di salvataggio a cui affidarsi se si vuole avere la certezza dell'implementazione delle sanzioni\". Senza un registro decente, non si potr\u00e0 convincere la gente della propria innocenza. Possiamo discutere se il registro debba essere di dominio pubblico oppure no, ma se le autorit\u00e0 non hanno accesso a determinate informazioni, allora non possono fare del loro meglio per attuare le sanzioni.",

Credo che la Svizzera debba guardare avanti, non indietro.",
                    "Tuttavia, \u00e8 importante ricordare che lo standard del GAFI \u00e8 uno standard minimo. Un Paese che si accontenta di soddisfare gli standard minimi suscita il sospetto di essere un Paese che facilita l'aggiramento delle sanzioni.",

Impegnandosi attivamente nel regime delle sanzioni, dimostrando che sta congelando i beni e sfruttando le competenze nazionali (ad esempio nel commercio di materie prime e nel private banking) per fare pressione sull'economia russa, contribuir\u00e0 ad allontanare i sospetti che ancora circondano la sua integrit\u00e0 finanziaria.",
                    "Le sanzioni sono concordate a Bruxelles, ma questa \u00e8 solo la cornice. Ogni Paese ha la propria legge di attuazione. Il risultato \u00e8 che ci sono definizioni diverse per termini come propriet\u00e0 e controllo. La maggior Parte degli Stati dice che se una persona sanzionata possiede una quota superiore al 50% di una determinata entit\u00e0, questa deve essere soggetta a sanzioni, ma l'interpretazione del controllo (quando una persona controlla ma non possiede una compagnia) differisce tra un Paese e l'altro. Questa mancanza di armonizzazione provoca falle che possono essere sfruttate.",
                    "\u00c8 anche importante dire che le banche sono da tempo sensibili al tema dell'attuazione delle sanzioni, perch\u00e9 esse stesse hanno avuto guai con la giustizia statunitense, ma le imprese europee hanno pochissima esperienza nell'implementazione delle sanzioni. Le compagnie attive nel commercio di materie prime hanno dovuto pensarci un po' in passato, ma non ai livelli attuali con la Russia.",

I nostri avvocati hanno approvato quello che stiamo facendo. Se cambier\u00e0 la legge, cambieremo il nostro modo di agire\".",
                    "Quello che mi piace chiedere ai politici e alle politiche \u00e8: cosa va cambiato nell'implementazione delle sanzioni contro alla Russia? Quali sono i passi da compiere per realizzare questo cambiamento? La risposta pi\u00f9 semplice potrebbe essere che tutti gli scambi commerciali con la Russia o con i Paesi intermediari che vendono alla Russia dovrebbero essere azzerati. E poi si discute della possibilit\u00e0 di concedere alcune esenzioni, ad esempio per i farmaci.",
                    "La mia idea \u00e8 che gli alleati dell'Ucraina debbano agire per impedire al Cremlino di finanziare e rifornire le proprie forze armate. Se questo \u00e8 il nostro obiettivo, dobbiamo assicurarci che le sanzioni su prodotti come l'elettronica ad alta tecnologia siano il pi\u00f9 possibile inattaccabili.",
                    "Ma sappiamo anche che la Russia sta passando da un'economia civile a un'economia militare e di guerra. Le fabbriche che producevano autobus ora producono carri armati. Dobbiamo quindi riflettere su quanto ampio debba essere l'embargo. Occorre quindi affrontare la questione della vendita a Paesi terzi attraverso i quali i prodotti potrebbero arrivare in Russia, cosa che sta chiaramente accadendo.",
                    "Ci sono aziende in Svizzera, Regno Unito, Germania e Francia che hanno visto aumentare le vendite a Paesi terzi non allineati dall'anno scorso. Queste aziende dovrebbero chiedersi perch\u00e9 queste vendite sono aumentate e se possono essere collegate all'elusione delle sanzioni russe - \u00e8 ingenuo pensare che non lo siano.",

A Vilnius sono stati concordati l'allargamento nell'Europa settentrionale e l'espansione delle relazioni nell'Indo-Pacifico, e all'Ucraina \u00e8 stata fatta la promessa di un processo di adesione.",
                    "La Confederazione, partner ufficiale della NATO dal 1997, non era presente a Vilnius. \"La Svizzera non \u00e8 stata invitata n\u00e9 come partecipante n\u00e9 come Paese osservatore\", indica il Dipartimento federale della difesa, della protezione della popolazione e dello sport (DDPS).",

                    "In effetti, secondo Pulli, l'adesione di Svezia e Finlandia alla NATO crea non solo nuove opportunit\u00e0, ma anche sfide per la Svizzera: \"Il gruppo di Stati europei partner della NATO \u00e8 diventato pi\u00f9 piccolo e ora ha meno peso nei confronti dell'Alleanza\".",

                    "A Vilnius, appare chiaro quanto siano diventate urgenti le questioni di sicurezza collettiva. Incuneata tra l'exclave russa di Kaliningrad a ovest e la Bielorussia a sud, la Lituania presenta molte analogie con la Berlino della Guerra Fredda: a\u00a0soli 30 chilometri dalla capitale, un confine protetto da alte recinzioni separa la zona europea (democratica) da quella russa (autoritaria).",

Le elezioni parlamentari svizzere non comportano grandi mutamenti? Ci\u00f2 dipende dal fatto che in Svizzera le cose non cambiano ogni quattro anni, ma letteralmente ogni giorno. Il motivo sono le frequenti votazioni a vari livelli \u2013 Confederazione, Cantoni e Comuni. L\u2019insegnamento forse pi\u00f9 importante che ne deriva \u00e8 che in Svizzera, un Paese di democrazia diretta, il risultato elettorale di un partito non \u00e8 determinante!",

Grazie agli strumenti dell\u2019iniziativa popolare e del referendum, in Svizzera la vittoria nelle elezioni parlamentari non permette ai partiti di fare il bello e il cattivo tempo nei seguenti quattro anni. Il giorno dopo le elezioni i partiti sono tenuti a proporre al popolo soluzioni per problemi concreti, rivolgendosi all\u2019elettorato con progetti di legge e iniziative popolari. Queste proposte sono spesso sottoposte al voto popolare e i vincitori di ieri possono subire domani cocenti sconfitte su una questione o sull\u2019altra.",

Poich\u00e9 i costi per la sicurezza sociale pesano sulle finanze pubbliche, le riforme che mirano a ridurre le spese in favore della popolazione pi\u00f9 anziana sono rinviate, mentre aumentano solo le tasse e i premi delle assicurazioni malattia che gravano sulle persone pi\u00f9 giovani.

Nei sondaggi dedicati ai temi pi\u00f9 importanti in vista delle elezioni, i premi delle assicurazioni malattia, l\u2019immigrazione e la riforma delle pensioni sono ai primi posti.

In Svizzera, dove l\u2019ultima parola su molti temi politici spetta al voto popolare, non importa mandare in Parlamento persone che si preoccupano delle esigenze della giovent\u00f9? Queste domande rimangono aperte.",

                    "Per il controspionaggio, quando si scopre una spia, \u00e8 talvolta pi\u00f9 proficuo sorvegliarla, piuttosto che intervenire pubblicamente. Naturalmente, questo lo sanno anche tutti gli Stati che hanno allontanato diplomatiche e diplomatici russi. \"Queste espulsioni rappresentano anche un segnale politico\", spiega H\u00e4nni. \"Tuttavia, dal febbraio 2022, alcuni Stati europei hanno espulso in modo molto mirato funzionari d'intelligence essenziali per le attivit\u00e0 delle basi di spionaggio nelle ambasciate. In alcuni casi, i loro posti sono stati subito soppressi, in modo che Mosca non potesse pi\u00f9 rioccuparli con nuove spie\".",

                    "In ogni caso, le autorit\u00e0 hanno gi\u00e0 molta esperienza in materia: lo spionaggio \u00e8 praticato a Ginevra fin dalla Prima guerra mondiale. Oggi, la citt\u00e0 sul Lemano ospita quasi 240 rappresentanze estere, decine di organizzazioni internazionali, centinaia di ONG.",
                    "\u00c8 quindi nella natura delle cose che qui scorrazzino anche numerosi agenti. Ginevra \u00e8 oggi considerata uno dei tre crocevia dello spionaggio in Europa, insieme a Bruxelles e Vienna.",
                    "Durante la Guerra fredda, Vienna era considerata la \"citt\u00e0 delle spie\": anche qui svolgevano un ruolo centrale la presenza di organizzazioni internazionali, la neutralit\u00e0 e la posizione geografica. Per molto tempo, in Austria il personale diplomatico che lavorava per i servizi segreti \u00e8 stato trattato come in Svizzera: aveva mano libera.",
                    "Ma l\u2019anno scorso c\u2019\u00e8 stata una svolta: l\u2019Austria si \u00e8 unita agli Stati dell\u2019UE e ha espulso diverse persone. In tal modo le autorit\u00e0 austriache hanno reagito alle dure accuse che le erano state rivolte di essere troppo filorusse e di intrattenere talvolta collaborazioni dirette con organi russi.",

                    "Ma altri fattori svolgono un ruolo: la Svizzera si trova nel cuore dell'Europa, \u00e8 perfettamente inserita nella rete dei trasporti, offre tutte le comodit\u00e0 di uno Stato occidentale e democratico e, fedele al suo profondo spirito democratico, si sforza di mantenere le migliori relazioni possibili con tutti i Paesi. Inoltre, le attivit\u00e0 di intelligence hanno un costo: nella discrezione della piazza finanziaria \u00e8 possibile sovvenzionare le operazioni e occultare l'origine dei fondi.",
                    "A Ginevra \u00e8 possibile preparare e portare a termine operazioni complesse. Grazie alle rivelazioni di Edward Snowden, ad esempio, si sa che gli Stati Uniti gestiscono a Ginevra uno Special Collection Service, una base di sorveglianza progettata per difficili operazioni di intercettazione. \u00c8 anche certo che nel 2015 Israele ha spiato i colloqui con l'Iran sul nucleare. In citt\u00e0 anche i servizi segreti francesi sono tradizionalmente attivi: negli anni Cinquanta vi hanno perfino orchestrato tentativi di assassinio.",
                    "Il rapporto del SIC esamina principalmente le attivit\u00e0 di spionaggio di Russia, Cina e Iran, sia perch\u00e9 rappresentano minacce attuali, sia perch\u00e9 non si vogliono mettere troppo sotto la lente le attivit\u00e0 degli Stati partner. Il SIC fa una distinzione interessante: la Russia pratica uno spionaggio \"classico\", diretto contro altri Stati, mentre Cina e Iran agiscono principalmente contro la propria diaspora.",
                    "H\u00e4nni, tuttavia, non \u00e8 del tutto d'accordo con questa valutazione: \"\u00c8 difficile fare una distinzione netta.

L'aumento delle operazioni di influenza \u00e8 evidente: si tenta di orientare l\u2019opinione pubblica in Occidente.",

                    "Secondo H\u00e4nni, le espulsioni renderanno sempre pi\u00f9 difficile per i servizi russi operare in Europa. Si aspetta quindi che la Russia si affidi sempre pi\u00f9 a \"illegali\": negli ultimi mesi ne sono stati scoperti in diversi Stati europei.",

Anche questo \u00e8 nel solco della tradizione: \"Durante la Guerra fredda la Svizzera ha svolto un ruolo chiave nel trasferimento di tecnologia dall'Ovest all'Est\".",
                    "Le modalit\u00e0 possono essere diverse: societ\u00e0 di facciata che, sotto la direzione di un servizio segreto, commerciano o accumulano conoscenze; personale reclutato da aziende tecnologiche locali; talvolta perfino normali transazioni commerciali di aziende locali in buona fede con le merci che poi raggiungono la Russia attraverso Paesi terzi.",
                    "L'imposizione di sanzioni ha causato in Russia problemi con i prodotti industriali.

Se il Centro finisse per prendere il posto del PLR come terza forza politica del Paese, rappresenterebbe uno sconvolgimento storico. Anche la composizione del Consiglio federale potrebbe essere messa in discussione, dal momento che la legge non scritta del principio di concordanza prevede che i tre maggiori partiti del Paese abbiano due seggi nel Governo e il quarto uno solo. \u00a0",

Dall'inizio della guerra israelo-palestinese, l'interesse del pubblico si \u00e8 decisamente spostato sulla situazione mondiale. Tuttavia, la copertura delle elezioni svizzere \u00e8 stata forse anche un po' stentata perch\u00e9, a differenza di quattro anni fa, nelle elezioni del 2023 non \u00e8 emerso un tema dominante durante la campagna elettorale.",

Nei 4'106 articoli di giornale analizzati nell'arco di otto settimane, \u00e8 emersa un'ampia gamma di argomenti: \"Assicurazione sanitaria, salute\" \u00e8 stato l'argomento pi\u00f9 frequente, ma anche banche, trasporti, energia, migrazione e clima erano presenti, scrivono Anja Heidelberger e Marc B\u00fchlmann nella loro analisi.",
                    "A differenza delle elezioni del 2019, che vengono ricordate come \"elezioni del clima\" e \"elezioni delle donne\", e delle elezioni del 2015, dove, in considerazione delle alte cifre relative all'asilo, la copertura della migrazione dominava su tutto, nel 2023 non si pu\u00f2 parlare di \"copertura mediatica prevalentemente monotematica\".",
                    "Le elezioni svizzere sono elezioni di mobilitazione. La bassa affluenza alle urne (46,9% delle persone aventi diritto di voto) rispetto agli standard internazionali fa s\u00ec che il risultato dipenda molto da quale partito riesce a mobilitare di pi\u00f9 la sua base. Marc B\u00fchlmann, direttore di Ann\u00e9e Politique Suisse, spiega cos\u00ec a swissinfo.ch l'interazione tra i media e la campagna elettorale: \"In Svizzera, con la sua bassa affluenza alle urne, la questione di chi riesce a mobilitare la propria base \u00e8 centrale in ogni campagna elettorale. Quattro anni fa, quando i Verdi erano visti dal movimento per il clima come un partito capace di risolvere i problemi ambientali, questo ha mobilitato maggiormente il loro elettorato\".",
                    "Oggi il partito ha avuto meno successo nell'utilizzare la questione climatica a suo vantaggio. Quando si parla di politica climatica, ad esempio in relazione agli attivisti e alle attiviste che si incollano a una strada e bloccano il traffico, questo non aiuta i Verdi.",
                    "Ann\u00e9e Politique Suisse analizza anche la frequenza con cui i partiti appaiono sui media. L'UDC, in quanto partito pi\u00f9 forte, viene citato pi\u00f9 spesso. Seguono PS, PLR e Centro.",
                    "Tuttavia, i partiti minori sono sottorappresentati rispetto ai quattro partiti di Governo: \"La quota complessiva dell'elettorato di questi partiti \u00e8 del 10,1%, ma la quota di articoli nei media \u00e8 solo del 3,4%\", si legge nell'analisi.",
                    "Sebbene i partiti siano presenti anche sui social media, B\u00fchlmann considera questi strumenti trascurabili. \"Gran parte dell'elettorato \u00e8 composto di persone di mezza et\u00e0, che non usano i social media per ottenere informazioni\", afferma B\u00fchlmann, pur riconoscendo che i partiti utilizzano i social media come canali di mobilitazione. Ma \"al momento potrebbe essere piuttosto difficile conquistare nuovi elettori e elettrici attraverso questo canale o convincerli\".",
                    "La piattaforma Politransparency mostra che il PS ha investito di pi\u00f9 in pubblicit\u00e0 su Facebook e Instagram con 429'100 franchi. Seguono il PLR, il Centro, i Verdi Liberali e i Verdi. L'UDC ha investito solo 112'000 franchi in questo campo.",
                    "Tuttavia, un video virale dell'UDC su Instagram ha raggiunto ben 300'000 persone - pi\u00f9 di qualsiasi altro video pubblicato da un account di partito su questo canale.",
                    "Secondo B\u00fchlmann, tuttavia, i giornali e i media tradizionali restano fondamentali. \"Essere sui media aiuta, \u00e8 una mobilitazione\", afferma B\u00fchlmann. \"Sarebbe per\u00f2 troppo facile concludere che un partito vince perch\u00e9 c'\u00e8 molta copertura. Il fatto che si parli di un partito \u00e8 comunque importante. Ma se questa copertura \u00e8 positiva o negativa non \u00e8 certo decisivo\".",

Una manna dal cielo per l'Unione democratica di centro (UDC, destra conservatrice), che ha incentrato la maggior parte della campagna elettorale sul suo tema prediletto, la lotta all'immigrazione.",
                    "Con l'aumento delle richieste di asilo (12'188 tra l'inizio di gennaio e la fine di giugno, il 43% in pi\u00f9 rispetto al 2022), che si aggiunge alla presenza di 65'000 persone rifugiate dall'Ucraina, l'UDC ha potuto sfruttare le crescenti preoccupazioni di una parte della popolazione.",
                    "Brandendo lo spettro di una Svizzera con 10 milioni di abitanti sui suoi manifesti, l'UDC non ha usato mezzi termini, attirandosi le critiche della Commissione federale contro il razzismo. Resta il fatto che questo messaggio molto chiaro ha avuto un effetto mobilitante sulla base del partito in un periodo di insicurezza a livello internazionale.",
                    "L'UDC ha inoltre trovato un capro espiatorio ideale in Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, la nuova ministra socialista incaricata dell'immigrazione. Questa tattica vincente, sperimentata gi\u00e0 pi\u00f9 volte in passato, ha permesso all'UDC di cancellare la sconfitta del 2019 e di avvicinarsi nuovamente al risultato record del 2015.",
                    "Con lo slogan \"Duro, ma giusto\", anche il Partito liberale radicale (PLR, destra liberale) ha fatto della politica migratoria uno dei suoi temi prioritari durante la campagna elettorale. A differenza dell'UDC, il PLR ha insistito sulla necessit\u00e0 di mantenere la libera circolazione delle persone per attirare in Svizzera una manodopera europea qualificata, insistendo al contempo sulla necessit\u00e0 di combattere il \"turismo sociale\" e il \"caos dell'asilo\".",
                    "Con questa posizione e con gli attacchi sorprendentemente virulenti a Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, il PLR non ha voluto lasciare il campo libero alla destra conservatrice su questo tema. Tuttavia, l'elettorato ha chiaramente dato pi\u00f9 credito alle soluzioni proposte dall'UDC.",
                    "In un periodo di piena occupazione, il PLR non ha inoltre potuto contare su un altro tema forte di mobilitazione. La cattiva gestione di Credit Suisse, rilevato dalla rivale UBS, ha dal canto suo certamente contribuito a danneggiare l'immagine del partito, storicamente molto legato alla piazza finanziaria svizzera.",
                    "Di conseguenza, il partito fondatore della Svizzera moderna ha marciato sul posto in queste elezioni, senza riuscire a invertire un declino che dura da tempo. Mentre all'inizio degli anni Ottanta otteneva il sostegno di quasi un quarto dell'elettorato, oggi il PLR convince poco pi\u00f9 di un elettore su sette.",

Il ritorno dell'inflazione e l'annuncio di un nuovo consistente aumento dei premi dell'assicurazione sanitaria (cassa malati) un mese prima dalle elezioni federali hanno riacceso i riflettori sulle questioni sociali. A sinistra, il PS \u00e8 cos\u00ec riuscito a sottrarre qualche voto ai Verdi.",

Il PS \u00e8 senza dubbio profeta a sinistra, ma continua a far fatica a reclutare oltre le sue aree tradizionali.",
                    "Anche se non ha stravolto tutto, \u00e8 comunque un momento storico per la politica svizzera: Il Centro \u00e8 testa a testa con il PLR per diventare la terza forza politica del Paese. A seconda dei risultati finali nelle due camere, potrebbe avere matematicamente diritto a un secondo seggio nel Governo svizzero (Consiglio federale). \u00c8 quello che prevede la \"formula magica\" in vigore dal 1959, secondo la quale i tre maggiori partiti detengono ciascuno due seggi nell'esecutivo nazionale, e il quarto uno solo.",

Probabilmente no, perch\u00e9 secondo un'altra regola non scritta i consiglieri e le consigliere federali rimangono in carica almeno fino al termine del loro mandato (ci sono state soltanto tre eccezioni negli ultimi 175 anni).",
                    "Lo stesso Partito popolare democratico (PPD), da cui \u00e8 nato Il Centro, ha beneficiato di questo principio quattro anni fa, quando \u00e8 stato superato per pochi voti dai Verdi. Nel 2021, il PPD si \u00e8 unito con il Partito borghese democratico sotto un nuovo nome, ritrovando una certa stabilit\u00e0.",

Sotto la presidenza di Gerhard Pfister, si \u00e8 liberato della sua proverbiale discrezione. In Consiglio nazionale, si conferma il partner di coalizione pi\u00f9 importante del PLR e dell'UDC, che insieme non hanno la maggioranza. Nel Consiglio degli Stati, dovrebbe rimanere la forza principale.",
                    "La Svizzera, una democrazia modello, \u00e8 stanca della politica. Con poco meno del 47%, l'affluenza alle urne nel 2023 \u00e8 stata leggermente superiore a quella del 2019 (45,1%). Tuttavia, come \u00e8 sempre successo negli ultimi decenni, pi\u00f9 della met\u00e0 delle persone con diritto di voto non si \u00e8 recata alle urne. E questo in un momento in cui le crisi non accennano a diminuire e il potere d'acquisto continua a ridursi in Svizzera.",
                    "Qual \u00e8 la ragione di questo silenzio da parte della maggioranza dell'elettorato? La causa principale dell'astensione potrebbe risiedere nell'inerzia insita del sistema svizzero. L'avanzata del 3% di un partito \u00e8 considerata quasi un terremoto politico. I rapporti di potere rimangono per\u00f2 quasi sempre invariati. A maggior ragione nel Governo, un bastione di stabilit\u00e0.",
                    "E se il Parlamento, un po' pi\u00f9 a sinistra o un po' pi\u00f9 a destra, dovesse prendere una decisione sgradevole, chi si \u00e8 astenuto ritiene di poterlo richiamare all'ordine con un referendum.",
                    "La campagna elettorale \u00e8 stata ben lontana dai momenti di tensione politica e dagli attacchi d'antologia osservati in altri Paesi. I partiti hanno presentato i loro programmi basandosi sui loro temi prediletti, senza invadere troppo il territorio delle formazioni avversarie. Non ci sono stati nemmeno veri e propri dibattiti di fondo sulle principali questioni politiche del momento. Il crollo di Credit Suisse e le relazioni con l'Unione Europea sono state assenti dalla campagna elettorale.",
                    "Tuttavia, questa non \u00e8 un'eccezione, ma piuttosto la regola nella tranquilla Svizzera. A parte i vivi dibattiti sull'immigrazione nel 2015 e l'incidente nucleare di Fukushima nel 2011, le campagne sono spesso blande. Si tratta di una caratteristica intrinseca della democrazia diretta svizzera: con delle votazioni federali che si tengono quattro volte l'anno, i partiti hanno molte altre occasioni per spiegare le loro posizioni sui vari temi.",
                    "Resta il fatto che, come ogni quattro anni, questa campagna elettorale ha permesso ai partiti di creare un legame con il popolo. Ogni persona candidata ha dovuto dare s\u00e9 stessa e stringere centinaia, se non migliaia, di mani nella speranza di mantenere o conquistare un seggio a Berna. Un momento raro e prezioso, anche in una democrazia svizzera spesso definita un esempio di vicinanza tra la gente e chi la rappresenta.",
                    "Oltre 220'000 cittadini e cittadine di nazionalit\u00e0 svizzera residenti all'estero sono iscritti in un registro elettorale. La tendenza della diaspora elvetica \u00e8 che sempre pi\u00f9 persone fanno ritorno in patria. In questo senso, \u00e8 legittimo che partecipino a votazioni e a elezioni.",
                    "L'elettorato della Quinta Svizzera \u00e8 in rapida crescita. Negli ultimi 30 anni \u00e8 pi\u00f9 che triplicato e se fosse un Cantone avrebbe diritto a sei seggi nel Consiglio nazionale. I partiti si contendono quindi sempre pi\u00f9 i voti di chi vive all'estero. Il PS, l'UDC, il PLR e il Centro sono attivi da tempo presso la diaspora e dispongono di sezioni internazionali. Queste hanno gi\u00e0 consentito ad alcuni candidati di ottenere i voti necessari per accedere al Parlamento.",
                    "Il Partito verde liberale \u00e8 stato l'ultimo dei grandi partiti a creare una sezione internazionale pin vista di queste elezioni. Si tratta di un buon abbinamento, perch\u00e9 il profilo politico degli svizzeri e delle svizzere all'estero coincide in larga misura con quello dei Verdi Liberali: in media, sono progressisti in ambito ecologico, difendono una societ\u00e0 liberale e sono favorevoli a una politica estera aperta.",
                    "Poich\u00e9 l'elettorato all'estero vota\u00a0maggiormente in funzione dei valori, \u00e8 forse anche pi\u00f9 fedele\u00a0a un partito. Nell'anno elettorale 2023, \u00e8 cos\u00ec stato\u00a0al centro di numerosi interventi parlamentari. C'\u00e8 persino stato un vero e proprio sprint finale a favore della Quinta Svizzera.",

According to Martina Mousson, a political scientist at gfs.bern, the Green Party\u2019s decline is linked to the current context, both abroad and in Switzerland.",
                    "The situation now is fundamentally different from the situation four years ago, she said. \u201cAlthough the climate remains one of the main concerns of the Swiss, it was clearly not a relevant issue for the elections and was overshadowed by other global themes\u201d, such as the war in Ukraine, the economic situation or inflation, Mousson said. \u201cSwitzerland is not the only country concerned.\u201d",

                    "On the other hand, in contrast to the national picture, the Swiss People\u2019s Party cannot be said to have triumphed at the ballot box among Swiss expatriates.",

                    "Overall, the way in which the diaspora voted confirms the tendency of this electorate to vote more to the left and more green than the domestic population. Between them, the main left-wing parties (Social Democrats and Greens) won almost 39% of the vote (compared with 27% for Switzerland as a whole); the combined strength of the ecologist parties (Greens and Liberal Greens) was 30% abroad (compared with 17% in Switzerland).\u00a0",
                    "The scores of the other parties remain relatively stable. The Centre Party gained 0.9 percentage points, a rise close to that achieved at national level (0.8 percentage points). For the Radical-Liberal Party, too, the trend is much the same among the Swiss Abroad as for voters in Switzerland: the centre-right party is down 0.6 percentage points (compared with 0.7 for the country as a whole).",
                    "As is often the case, voter turnout among the Swiss Abroad remained low, at 18.7% (compared with 46.6% nationally), and was down in virtually all cantons with the exception of Basel City and St Gallen. At national level, however, it rose slightly compared with 2019, from 45.1% to 46.6%.",

                    "The most recent election of a parliamentarian from abroad was that of Tim Guldimann for the Social Democrats in canton Zurich. He achieved a brilliant result in 2015, winning 102,757 votes. At the time, he was not the first Swiss Abroad to sit in parliament, but the first to be elected while living abroad. Guldimann resigned in 2018, arguing that it was difficult to \u201clive in one environment and do politics in another\u201d.",

Es wurde von anderen Themen \u00fcberlagert\", so Mousson \u2013 der Ukraine-Krieg, die Wirtschaftslage, die Konjunktur, die Teuerung. \"Davon ist nicht nur die Schweiz betroffen\", sagt die Politologin.",

                    "Die wichtigste Ver\u00e4nderung im Wahlverhalten der Auslandschweizer:innen im Jahr 2023 scheint somit ein Transfer der Stimmen, die 2019 an die Gr\u00fcnen gegangen waren, hin zur SP zu sein.",

Die Gr\u00fcnen sind wohl Opfer von der Themenkonjunktur geworden\", sch\u00e4tzt Mousson ein. Umgekehrt h\u00e4tten sie vor vier Jahren von der Themenlage profitiert.",

Weil Cuttat, der beim Schweizerischen Roten Kreuz arbeitet, auf der Hauptliste der Berner SP-M\u00e4nner-Liste aufgef\u00fchrt war, ist das gute Resultat im Vergleich zu den anderen Auslandschweizer:innen nachvollziehbar. Auf seiner Liste weist Cuttat hingegen das schlechteste Resultat aus. Die SP ist die zweitst\u00e4rkste Partei im Kanton Bern, sie holte 5 Sitze.",

Er erzielte 2015 ein Glanzresultat und holte sich 102'757 Stimmen. Er war damals nicht der erste Auslandschweizer im Parlament, aber der erste, der als Auslandschweizer gew\u00e4hlt wurde. Guldimann trat 2018 zur\u00fcck. Seinen R\u00fccktritt begr\u00fcndete damit, dass es schwierig sei, \"in einem Milieu zu leben und in einem anderen Milieu Politik zu machen\".",

Un tema estremamente controverso nella Confederazione: \"La Svizzera aveva dei contatti, che ora si vuole interrompere [si riferisce al cambio di rotta del Consiglio federale che vuole designare Hamas come organizzazione terroristica, ndr].
