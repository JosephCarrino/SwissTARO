But a pattern suggests itself when you take into account the looming presence of the NZZ media group, whose affiliate publications skew centre-right to right-wing editorially, the courting of outrage from the left \u2013 at one point, Roman Polanski was slated to make an appearance at this year\u2019s festival \u2013 and the lip service being paid to open debate without delivering on that promise.\nIn effect, the ZFF performs a delicate balancing act, wrapping itself in the broadly progressive trappings of contemporary film culture whilst giving a nod and a wink to the conservative sceptics of that very progressivism.\u202f\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwiss chocolate-maker L\u00e4derach is in damage limitation mode after allegations of abuse at a religious school co-founded by the company\u2019s former boss. \nAnd the tendency transcends film. Following\u202f\n\u202fchronicling the abuse suffered by pupils at the hands of J\u00fcrg L\u00e4derach, the co-founder and former head of the Swiss chocolate-maker bearing his name, the ZFF swiftly terminated its commercial partnership with the L\u00e4derach brand. \n that \u201cmany people found the SRF documentary disturbing,\u201d while also stressing that \u201cthere are no allegations towards the current management of L\u00e4derach,\u201d and concluding that it wants to focus \u201csolely on the joy of cinema\u201d. The festival declined to elaborate further on the matter.\u00a0\nIn the face of the fact that buying L\u00e4derach chocolate has since become a point of pride in \u201canti-cancel culture\u201d circles, this reticence to address the actual allegations that ostensibly led to the break with the brand speaks to what seems to be the festival\u2019s overarching philosophy: don\u2019t rock the boat.\nIn other words, superficially engage with the progressive tendencies of the times without alienating even its more reactionary opponents. So far, it has proved a viable strategy financially. But, with political polarisation on the rise, it may prove an unsustainable strategy in the long run.\u00a0\nArticles in this story\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

Some of Raetz\u2019s most well-known three-dimensional artworks are on display next to a spatial installation,\u202f",

                    "More than half a century of industrious activity left a broad range of experiments with materials, surfaces\u00a0and techniques. If one were to define Raetz\u2019s work in a word, it would certainly be \u201cperception\u201d. Or, more precisely, \u201caltering perceptions\u201d, but not restricted to the psychedelic exhortations of the term that was all the rage among many of his contemporaries in the 1960s and 1970s.\u00a0",
                    "In fact, he was very much an artist of his time, having also surfed the lysergic waves of the 1960s counterculture. Raetz opened what British writer Aldous Huxley called the \u201cdoors of perception\u201d and dove deep into its essential meaning, or the nature of perception. The main question throughout his career, according to his widow, Monika, was: \u201cis this the only way to see things?\u201d\u00a0",
                    "The exhibition in Bern answers this question, artwork by artwork, with a clear \u201cno\u201d.\u00a0",
                    "The Swiss critic Max Wechsler wrote in 1984 in the ",
                    "that \u201cthe art of Markus Raetz can be defined in a fundamental way: as the tension between intelligence and sensibility [\u2026]\u00a0growing out of this tension is a kind of force field which sets everything else in motion and allows the art to appear in all its ambiguity of meaning\u201d.",
                    "Raetz\u2019s works demand a certain interaction of the viewer, as changes of perspective lead to different perceptions of the pieces. The apparent simplicity of the works \u2013 sometimes consisting of just a torn wire \u2013 conceals careful studies on the optical effects of materials and forms. His brother, a physicist, also played a role in Raetz\u2019s mathematical calculations.\u00a0",
                    "Raetz was a relentless drawing machine. He always had a sketchbook on hand that served as an illustrated journal of his reveries and studies. Some of the sketches, displayed now in Bern, can be contemplated as artworks themselves. For the artist, drawing was always the first step in making all his works, including sculptures.\u00a0",
                    "Raetz was very fortunate to be at the right place at the right time. The Swiss capital, Bern, where he was born in 1941, grew up and eventually died, has never been a global artistic focal point \u2013 except for a brief period in the 1960s when pioneer curator Harald Szeemann ran the local Kunsthalle (1963-69). That coincided with the moment when Raetz decided to leave his teaching career to devote himself to art.\u00a0",
                    "At the time, Szeemann transformed Bern into one of the leading centres of the avant-garde, culminating with the milestone exhibition \u201cWhen Attitudes become Form\u201d. Its radicality and the predominance of conceptual art eventually cost Szeemann his job in Bern.\u00a0\u00a0",
                    "Raetz was one of the local artists who fell under Szeemann\u2019s spell during that decade. He accompanied the curator in some of his other international shows, such as the documenta 5 in Kassel, Germany (1972) \u2013 another milestone in the history of 20th-century art.\u00a0",
                    "Szeemann\u2019s influence went beyond his singular personality and artworks. The ambience created by the curator fostered myriad connections between Swiss artists and the global avant-garde, bringing art movements such as pop art, conceptualism, situationism, Fluxus and Neo-Dada closer to home.\u00a0",
                    "Raetz also struck up an intense friendship with the grande dame of Swiss art, Meret Oppenheim, who had moved to the Swiss capital in 1967 to mix with that young, wild crowd.\u00a0",
                    "When the Bern scene began to wither in 1969, Raetz and his wife Monika moved to Amsterdam. This period abroad, marked by extensive travels while living in a much more inspiring environment than stiff Switzerland, consolidated Raetz\u2019s working methods and interests.\u00a0",
                    "Raetz returned for good to Bern in 1976, after a couple of years spent in Carona, a tiny village in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino and Meret Oppenheim\u2019s favourite haunt until her death (she\u2019s also buried there). He had by then become one of the most prolific Swiss artists, with a constant flow of exhibitions in the main European capitals.\u00a0",
                    "In the mid-1980s, Raetz had his breakthrough in the American scene thanks to a solo exhibition in the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York (1988). That same year, he represented Switzerland at the 43rd\u202fVenice Biennale. \u202f\u00a0",
                    "Before turning 50, Raetz was already an established name on the Swiss and international art circuits, but notoriety for him simply meant the possibility of working constantly on a steady output that defied not just the perception of the artworks but also of spaces.",
                    "His 3D objects play with the perception of their exhibition sites\u00a0\u2013 expanding, compressing or distorting them. Many of them also enter into dialogue with Raetz\u2019s most affectionate influences, such as the Belgian surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte, the American photo-artist Man Ray, or Mickey Mouse.\u00a0",
                    "It is maybe still too early to make a comprehensive assessment of Raetz\u2019s importance in the universe of contemporary art. But he certainly epitomises some peculiar characteristics shared by a handful of Swiss artists who shot to fame abroad, like Fischli & Weiss, Max Bill, Meret Oppenheim or Alberto Giacometti.",
                    "We could mention the deceptive simplicity that leads to various interpretations and layers of meaning; a constant quest for the essence of materials and the human experience; the playful arrangements of words and concepts. But none of these can be attributed to any kind of \u201cSwiss way\u201d of making art, not even Raetz\u2019s prolific work ethos, similar to his contemporary ",
                    " for whom \u201cart is just work\u201d.",
                    "The clich\u00e9s of Swiss Protestant-Calvinist mores, though, do not apply to Raetz\u2019s art.

                "en_content": "One of the most prominent Swiss artists of the past 50 years, Raetz died on April 14, 2020, one month into the national Covid-19 lockdown. His work and memory were mentioned all over the Swiss press, although with no fanfare; internationally his passing went almost\u00a0\n.\nThe subdued obituaries and the impossibility of any kind of public celebration \u2013 due to the health restrictions \u2013 of Raetz\u2019s life and works left a gap which the Bern Museum of Fine Arts (Kunstmuseum Bern) is now attempting to fill.\u00a0A large retrospective is running until February 25, 2024. Some of Raetz\u2019s most well-known three-dimensional artworks are on display next to a spatial installation,\u202f\n(Clouds, 2020), planned by the artist but never executed.\u00a0\nMore than half a century of industrious activity left a broad range of experiments with materials, surfaces\u00a0and techniques. If one were to define Raetz\u2019s work in a word, it would certainly be \u201cperception\u201d. Or, more precisely, \u201caltering perceptions\u201d, but not restricted to the psychedelic exhortations of the term that was all the rage among many of his contemporaries in the 1960s and 1970s.\u00a0\nIn fact, he was very much an artist of his time, having also surfed the lysergic waves of the 1960s counterculture. Raetz opened what British writer Aldous Huxley called the \u201cdoors of perception\u201d and dove deep into its essential meaning, or the nature of perception. The main question throughout his career, according to his widow, Monika, was: \u201cis this the only way to see things?\u201d\u00a0\nThe exhibition in Bern answers this question, artwork by artwork, with a clear \u201cno\u201d.\u00a0\nThe Swiss critic Max Wechsler wrote in 1984 in the \nthat \u201cthe art of Markus Raetz can be defined in a fundamental way: as the tension between intelligence and sensibility [\u2026]\u00a0growing out of this tension is a kind of force field which sets everything else in motion and allows the art to appear in all its ambiguity of meaning\u201d.\nRaetz\u2019s works demand a certain interaction of the viewer, as changes of perspective lead to different perceptions of the pieces. The apparent simplicity of the works \u2013 sometimes consisting of just a torn wire \u2013 conceals careful studies on the optical effects of materials and forms. His brother, a physicist, also played a role in Raetz\u2019s mathematical calculations.\u00a0\nRaetz was a relentless drawing machine. He always had a sketchbook on hand that served as an illustrated journal of his reveries and studies. Some of the sketches, displayed now in Bern, can be contemplated as artworks themselves. For the artist, drawing was always the first step in making all his works, including sculptures.\u00a0\nRaetz was very fortunate to be at the right place at the right time. The Swiss capital, Bern, where he was born in 1941, grew up and eventually died, has never been a global artistic focal point \u2013 except for a brief period in the 1960s when pioneer curator Harald Szeemann ran the local Kunsthalle (1963-69). That coincided with the moment when Raetz decided to leave his teaching career to devote himself to art.\u00a0\nAt the time, Szeemann transformed Bern into one of the leading centres of the avant-garde, culminating with the milestone exhibition \u201cWhen Attitudes become Form\u201d. Its radicality and the predominance of conceptual art eventually cost Szeemann his job in Bern.\u00a0\u00a0\nRaetz was one of the local artists who fell under Szeemann\u2019s spell during that decade. He accompanied the curator in some of his other international shows, such as the documenta 5 in Kassel, Germany (1972) \u2013 another milestone in the history of 20th-century art.\u00a0\nSzeemann\u2019s influence went beyond his singular personality and artworks. The ambience created by the curator fostered myriad connections between Swiss artists and the global avant-garde, bringing art movements such as pop art, conceptualism, situationism, Fluxus and Neo-Dada closer to home.\u00a0\nRaetz also struck up an intense friendship with the grande dame of Swiss art, Meret Oppenheim, who had moved to the Swiss capital in 1967 to mix with that young, wild crowd.\u00a0\nWhen the Bern scene began to wither in 1969, Raetz and his wife Monika moved to Amsterdam. This period abroad, marked by extensive travels while living in a much more inspiring environment than stiff Switzerland, consolidated Raetz\u2019s working methods and interests.\u00a0\nRaetz returned for good to Bern in 1976, after a couple of years spent in Carona, a tiny village in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino and Meret Oppenheim\u2019s favourite haunt until her death (she\u2019s also buried there). He had by then become one of the most prolific Swiss artists, with a constant flow of exhibitions in the main European capitals.\u00a0\nIn the mid-1980s, Raetz had his breakthrough in the American scene thanks to a solo exhibition in the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York (1988). That same year, he represented Switzerland at the 43rd\u202fVenice Biennale. \u202f\u00a0\nBefore turning 50, Raetz was already an established name on the Swiss and international art circuits, but notoriety for him simply meant the possibility of working constantly on a steady output that defied not just the perception of the artworks but also of spaces.\nHis 3D objects play with the perception of their exhibition sites\u00a0\u2013 expanding, compressing or distorting them. Many of them also enter into dialogue with Raetz\u2019s most affectionate influences, such as the Belgian surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte, the American photo-artist Man Ray, or Mickey Mouse.\u00a0\nIt is maybe still too early to make a comprehensive assessment of Raetz\u2019s importance in the universe of contemporary art. But he certainly epitomises some peculiar characteristics shared by a handful of Swiss artists who shot to fame abroad, like Fischli & Weiss, Max Bill, Meret Oppenheim or Alberto Giacometti.\nWe could mention the deceptive simplicity that leads to various interpretations and layers of meaning; a constant quest for the essence of materials and the human experience; the playful arrangements of words and concepts. But none of these can be attributed to any kind of \u201cSwiss way\u201d of making art, not even Raetz\u2019s prolific work ethos, similar to his contemporary \n for whom \u201cart is just work\u201d.\nThe clich\u00e9s of Swiss Protestant-Calvinist mores, though, do not apply to Raetz\u2019s art. Even if it provokes a smile rather than a laugh, it reflects the quiet joy that Raetz displayed while conceiving and making his pieces. It\u2019s a lot of work, yes, but fundamentally it\u2019s fun and pleasure.\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

                "en_content": "I spot Boris Collardi beaming handsomely, one arm outstretched, on the terrace of Le Creux de Genthod. He is framed by a scene of unnervingly cinematic allure: gingham tablecloths catch the breeze, and motor launches and sailboats bob on Le L\u00e9man, the peaks of the Mont Blanc massif in the distance.\nCollardi \u2014 one of the best-known figures in Swiss banking, and perhaps one of the best-connected men in finance \u2014 booked two restaurants for lunch, both a few miles outside the city of his birth, Geneva, and a few metres from where he now lives. Since the September weather is so fine, here we are at the lakeside.\nTwo years ago, aged 47, his glittering career looked like it was unspooling as, amid damning regulatory criticism and questions about his ambition and scruples, he appeared to crash out of banking altogether, from his golden perch at Geneva\u2019s Pictet & Cie. He\u2019d been made chief executive of Switzerland\u2019s third largest private bank, Julius Baer, at just 34.\nFor admirers, Collardi was a restless showman who seemed to be everywhere all at once: an arm around Leonardo DiCaprio in St Tropez one day; a champagne flute at the Hong Kong jockey club with some local billionaires the next. And, for a time, it seemed as if no job in global banking, let alone in Switzerland, was beyond him.\nFor critics, though, he represented all that was most reckless about Swiss banking, driven post-financial crisis to hoover up as much filthy lucre as it could from around the world \u2014 of which, thanks to quantitative easing, there was a superabundance \u2014 using charm and style to paper over the loss of its promise of total secrecy.\n\u201cI don\u2019t personify the problems [in Swiss banking]!\u201d Collardi protests later during our lunch together. Regardless, it is a timely moment to consider them. It is, after all, just six months since the near-catastrophic collapse of Credit Suisse. \u201cIt feels very much like the Swiss brand is on the defensive,\u201d he says.\nBut before all that, we get chatting about wine.\n\u201cI have become an advocate for Swiss wines,\u201d Collardi tells me, enjoining me to choose a glass as we sit down \u2014 but insisting we take something local.\nHe has purchased a small domaine, Bec d\u2019Or, not so far from where we are. (The name, \u201cgolden beak\u201d, seems most apt.) The climate and elevation are remarkably similar to Burgundy, Collardi says, \u201cso we can plant the same \n [varieties]\u201d.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nCan Hong Kong or Singapore supplant Switzerland as the world's premier wealth management centre? \nAlthough I am happy to take his recommendation, Collardi insists we try a couple of different whites before choosing. The waiter fetches us two locals: a Chardonnay and a Muscat. We both plump for the Chardonnay, which is crisp and lightly oaked, not unlike a good Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9.\nTwo simple \n lettuce salads soon arrive, dressed in a classic vinaigrette.\nHis mid-life retirement, I say, seems to suit him. Collardi is still a charismatic figure, but somehow shorn of his edge over our lunch. He tells me about a recent 70th birthday party he attended on a private yacht. He knew most people there, but for the first time he could speak to them as Boris Collardi, rather than Boris Collardi, the banker. \u201cIt removes a barrier when you meet another person and they know you\u2019re not going to ask them for their money.\u201d\nAs well as his vineyard, Collardi has, in 24 months, struck out in a range of new directions.\nHe has invested in a luxury health clinic, The Longevity Suite, and Ares Design, the Modena-based supercar manufacturer. He has become a patron and director of US Lecce, the Pugliese football team who have, coincident with Collardi\u2019s arrival, been promoted into Italy\u2019s top league, Serie A.\nAnd then there is his involvement in EFG International.\nHaving long been friends with the billionaire Latsis family, he bought a 3.6% stake in the Swiss bank from them in April last year (they retain 45%) and took a seat on its board. Which, of course, has set many tongues wagging. Maybe Collardi\u2019s days as one of the biggest rainmakers in private banking are not over yet?\nSpearing crisp leaves of salad, we seem to have strayed into tougher conversational terrain.\nCollardi\u2019s career at the top began in tragedy \u2014 an issue he has never discussed publicly before.\nOn December 3 2008, Alex Widmer, Julius Baer\u2019s chief executive and Collardi\u2019s mentor, killed himself. Collardi, nearly 20 years his junior, was his executor and had to sort out the affairs of his three children.\n\u201cIf you\u2019d said to me, think of the most crazy scenario of what could happen to Alex, I don\u2019t think I would ever have said this was a person who could take his [own] life. It was beyond the understanding of anybody,\u201d says Collardi, slowly turning the wine glass in front of him by its stem.\nIt was, Collardi reminds me, still the height of the global banking crisis when the tragedy happened. \u201cYou could feel on some days that it was a bit of an end-of-the-world sort of time,\u201d he says. One evening, just days before Widmer died, Collardi invited his boss over to his house to cook together and relax.\n\u201cHe said to me, \u2018Oh God, we have this bank to run, and I have this construction project here and this project there and it\u2019s all too much for me.\u2019 And I said to him, \u2018I\u2019ll take over this and that at the bank, and just tell me where I can help.\u2019\u201d He pauses. \u201cYou feel like you have not been able to get through to the person. Like you have not been able to give a hand to that person when they needed it.\n\u201cAnd also, you . . . you get a bit pissed off to be honest. Because you say, \u2018Why choose this ultimate measure, which is so irreversible, when there\u2019s 50 other things we could have done?\u2019\u201d\nBaer\u2019s share price tanked as, amid the febrile market environment, investors began to think that the bank might be hiding huge problems.\n\u201cContrary to what people may think, I didn\u2019t just go forward and say to the board [of Julius Baer], \u2018I\u2019m the designated successor\u2019,\u201d says Collardi. It was Raymond Baer, the bank\u2019s chair (and scion of its founding family) who called him a few weeks later, at the end of the year, and told him he should put his name in the hat to be the bank\u2019s next chief executive.\n\u201cI went in seriously. I prepared . . . But I genuinely never thought I would get the job. It\u2019s a Z\u00fcrich establishment bank. I\u2019m an outsider. I\u2019m too young. I\u2019ve never been a front office manager in my entire life.\u201d\nHe was already planning to quit \u2014 he\u2019d bought a guide to Unesco World Heritage Sites that he wanted to visit on gardening leave.\n\u201cThey called and they said, \u2018Look, we have good news and bad news. The good news is that the selection process is over. The bad news is you\u2019re not going to be able to go travelling.\u2019\u201d\nOur main courses arrive. We have opted for the restaurant\u2019s speciality: a dozen fillets of L\u00e9man perch each, cooked \n.\nThe plate is heaped with french fries. \u201cI hope you\u2019re not on a diet,\u201d says Collardi. Absolutely not, I assure him. Shall we have more wine, I suggest?\nRoute du Creux-de-Genthod 29, Genthod, Geneva, Switzerland\nSalad x2 (complimentary)\u00a0\nFilets de perches du L\u00e9man \u2018tradition\u2019 meuni\u00e8re x2 CHF102\nCoupe D\u00e4nemark x2 CHF22\u00a0\nCh\u00e2teau d\u2019Auvernier Chardonnay x4 CHF30\u00a0\nHenniez mineral water x2 CHF12.60\nDouble espresso CHF7.90\nEarl Grey CHF4.10\u00a0\n (inc service) CHF200 ($224)\nThe fillets are beautifully delicate, firm and slightly crisp.

And when Widmer moved to Julius Baer, it was Collardi he thought of as the young dynamo he could bring with him to look after the details of his grand new plans.\nIn 2021, Finma, Switzerland\u2019s ordinarily quiescent market regulator, issued a damning regulatory judgment against Julius Baer. It covered the years 2009 to 2018, a period entirely coincident with Collardi\u2019s time as chief executive.\nThe bank, Finma said, \u201cfell significantly short in combating money laundering\u201d. Finma had focused on just two cases: dirty Venezuelan oil money stashed at the bank and millions in bribes paid to corrupt officials of Fifa, the governing body of world football, who had also found Baer to be a haven for their loot.\nIt wrote a personal reprimand to Collardi \u2014 although concluded that punitive action against him was unwarranted.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nQuitting the top job at Julius Baer to become a partner at Pictet has ramifications beyond the boardrooms of Switzerland\u2019s middle-tier private banks. \n\u201cI find the image of saying \u2018Oh, Boris was a business builder but he cut corners\u2019 not to be extremely fair, because there were issues before me, there were issues during my time, and there were issues after me,\u201d Collardi says when I ask about his reputation.\n\u201cThere is no magic formula for this in [private] banking,\u201d he continues. \u201cDid we create our own set of issues?

The buck stopped with me . . . So I\u2019ve certainly learnt something, but I\u2019ve also moved on.\u201d\nWhen Collardi started as chief executive, Julius Baer was managing the assets of the super-rich worth CHF159 billion.

The people I talk to in Asia are all asking, \u2018OK, so can we now still trust Switzerland?\u2019\u201d\nDefeated by ice cream, I take a double espresso, and Collardi an Earl Grey tea.\nThe idea that Collardi\u2019s exit from Pictet represents any form of early retirement is, it strikes me, most unlikely. I ask about EFG. Is something strategic in the offing? Do the Latsis want to sell? Will he use the bank as some kind of means to a spectacular comeback?\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the chance to be the chief executive of a bank for more than 10 years. What can I possibly do that is going to be better than that?\u201d He pauses. \u201cI should already be very satisfied with that.\u201d\nIt sounds almost as if he is trying to convince himself.\nWe put our napkins on the table and stand up to leave \u2014 with a short detour to the lakeshore, where Collardi gamely offers to take some photos of visiting tourists for them on their phones.\n\u201cYou may recall this very famous Chinese saying that a thousand-mile journey starts with a single step,\u201d he tells me before we say our goodbyes. \u201cI\u2019ve taken my single step!\u201d\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2023\n\u00a9 2023 The Financial Times Ltd.

                "en_content": "Laurent Favre is one person who has an answer. A tenth-generation member of the Favre & Fils watchmaking family, his company\u2019s latest product is a watch that will also serve as a cryptocurrency wallet. A prototype for the CHF 100,000 watch is in the works. Will a bet on new technology pay off for a traditional company that traces its roots to 1718?\u202f\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like figuring out the future of steam engines in the age of electric trains,\u201d he told swissinfo.ch for a recent report. \u201cYou have to keep adding relevant features that advance the design.\u201d\u00a0\nThe traditional Swiss watchmaking industry has come back from the brink many a time despite predictions of its imminent demise. It has lived with the constant threat of disruption for decades and has had to learn to adapt to new technologies.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nUnlike the British watchmaking industry that died out long ago, the Swiss makers survived the advent of American-inspired factory production in the 19th century by emulating its ways.\u202f\u00a0\nAnother significant challenge was the Quartz crisis of the 1970s. Even though the technology for Quartz watches was invented in Switzerland, it did not find favour with Swiss watchmakers.\u202f\u00a0\nJapanese competitors, like Seiko, embraced Quartz movements, thus providing watches that were cheaper and more accurate than anything the Swiss could produce. Several Swiss companies did not survive the disruption. Still, an answer to the Quartz was eventually found in the form of Swatch watches.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe quartz watch, a Swiss invention subsequently commercialized and mass-marketed by Japanese companies, celebrates its 50th birthday this month. \nA more recent challenge was the launch of the Apple Watch and other smart devices that, although not their strongest selling point, also tell the time. Many predicted that smartwatches would dominate the watch market given Apple\u2019s trendsetting success with the iPhone. So far, only Swiss watchmakers producing more affordable timepieces dipped their toes in this new segment with most preferring to stick to what they know best.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nForty years after Japanese quartz watches brought the Swiss watch industry to its knees, the sector faces a new challenge in the \u201csmartwatch\u201d. \nNew political and economic realities in major markets like China and Russia made a dent on sales. In China, a crackdown on corruption included a ban on party officials accepting gifts like luxury watches. In Russia, worsening economic prospects did not help either. \u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSlower economic growth and a Chinese government anti-corruption campaign have cast a shadow over Swiss watch exports to China. \nSome threats were internal too. For over a decade the Swatch Group has wanted to stop supplying mechanism by its unit ETA \u2013 a workhorse watch movement popular among affordable brands \u2013 to its competitors. The anti-monopoly commission at first objected and then backed down, but by then the company had changed its own mind.\u202f\u00a0\nThe uncertainty over the outcome of this tussle has made smaller watchmakers, who rely on ETA movements, anxious over the future supply of these crucial elements.\u202f\u00a0\nOther companies in the sector say that they are struggling to cope with more stringent \u201cSwiss Made\u201d label requirements imposed by parliament starting in 2017. Under the updated legislation, the minimum threshold of domestically produced parts rose from 50% to 60%.\u00a0This is likely to make Swiss watches at the lower price range more expensive and hence more vulnerable to cheaper competition.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest watch fair is where new luxury watches are launched. swissinfo.ch went looking for low-budget alternatives. \nThere is also a danger of a vicious circle taking hold as part of a trend where fewer but more expensive Swiss watches are being sold. Lack of scale could make it difficult for the industry to raise the money needed to pay for innovation.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nA ruling by the Swiss competition watchdog is set to prolong a bitter battle among watchmakers over the delivery of moving parts. \nThe Covid-19 pandemic has not helped matters. The very existence of the world\u2019s biggest watch fair Baselworld is under threat due to the exodus of exhibitors following the cancellation of the 2020 edition. Around 40,000 employees in the Swiss watch industry are on partial employment to cut costs and exports in 2020 are expected to decline by 25% - more than during the quartz crisis in 1975 or subprime mortgage recession of 2009. \u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s watchmaking industry is likely to suffer the worst crisis of its history in 2020. But experts are confident it can recover. \nDespite all the problems, the Swiss watch industry\u2019s \u201cwait and watch\u201d policy has enabled it to weather a lot of storms and avoid succumbing to fads. Mechanical timepieces made in Switzerland remain a status symbol as evidenced by a thriving fake and grey market. \u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nDestocking new watches and selling them through alternative channels is a taboo subject in the Swiss watchmaking industry. \nSwiss watches are still highly coveted, even if they\u2019re no longer needed to tell the time.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nWhy is Switzerland so dominant in this sector?

The reason for this \n: \u201cvoting rights for a large part of the population are limited and Muslims face legal and de facto discrimination\u201d.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSince the creation of the Swiss federal state in 1848, the number of people gaining voting rights has risen steadily. \nThe\u00a0\n (EIU) another well-known democracy ranking group, offers a similar appraisal of the Alpine democracy, but for a different reason: \u201clow voter turnout\u201d. Worldwide, both ranking institutes diagnose an even worse situation in their latest reports: \n\u201d, says EIU, while \n summarises: \u201cAs a lethal pandemic, economic and physical insecurity, and violent conflict ravaged the world, democracy\u2019s defenders sustained heavy new losses in their struggle against authoritarian foes, shifting the international balance in favor of tyranny.\u201d This happens (half) a century after the breakthrough for universal suffrage.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe risk of international reputational damage was another factor that brought an end to the Swiss resistance to giving women the vote 50 years ago. \nFor a country like Switzerland, which experienced the first successful democratic revolution in Europe in 1848 and which for a long time was a liberal island in a monarchic continent, these critical assessments from international researchers can work as a healthy wake-up call, says Roger de Weck \u2013 the author and journalist who published a book earlier this year outlining 12 proposals to make Swiss democracy more democratic.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nAuthor, journalist, and ex-SBC head Roger de Weck analyses how to modernise democracy in a book to appear this week. \nSwitzerland is of course not alone in needing a democratic check-up, especially since the\u00a0pandemic has thrown up the latest challenge to free societies. But how can a democratic diagnosis be done in a fair and transparent way?\nDavid Altman, professor of political science at the Catholic University of Santiago de Chile and author of\u00a0\u201cCitizenship and Contemporary Direct Democracy\u201d, has followed efforts to measure democracy for many years: \u201cWe are witnessing a return to scientific expertise and evidence-based assessments,\u201d says Altman, who is also one of the architects of the \n (V-Dem) research project \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest data collection effort aiming to conceptualise and measure democracy.\nMore\n\nDirect democracy, federalism, and neutrality in foreign affairs are central components of the Swiss political system. \nV-Dem offers a new approach to the world of democracy measurement: \u201cWe employ 170 country coordinators and 3,000 experts, who compile and compare more than 350 different indicators,\u201d says Anna L\u00fchrmann, the Deputy Director of V-Dem based at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. And unlike similar projects, their statistics are accessible: \u201cOur datasets are open and transparent for all, and can be used like Lego blocks to build your research or analysis,\u201d L\u00fchrmann says. Indeed,\u00a0V-Dem\u2019s open data set\u00a0is now used by a growing network of international organisations such as the\u00a0\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0and\u00a0\n.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe world is currently witnessing a wave of autocratisation, and yet over half of all countries remain democracies. \nThe Gothenburg-based group also publishes its own annual report and uses the data for specific situational reports like the\u00a0Pandemic Backsliding Risk Index, which reveals that 55 autocratic and 32 democratic countries experienced corona-related limitations to human rights and civic freedoms in 2020.\nUnsurprisingly for a sensitive \u2013 and some would say subjective \u2013 topic like democracy, the rankings are not without critics.\n\u201cThere are two problems with most democracy rankings\u201d, says Matt Qvortrup, professor of political science and international relations at Coventry University. \u201cFirst, their raw data are not publicly available; second, their indicators are biased towards traditional forms of representative government\u201d.\nAs a consequence of such a bias, newer forms of participatory and direct democracy are underrated in the rankings, something which \u2013 according to Qvortrup \u2013 penalises countries like Switzerland, Uruguay, Taiwan or even Germany and the United States (at the regional and local level).

                "en_content": "More and more women are taking the lead in Swiss art museums \u2013 most recently \n. But much needs to be done to bring more art works produced by women on the walls of art institutions.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nWomen are not visible enough in the Swiss art world, says Fanni Fetzer, the director of the Lucerne Art Museum. \nIn Switzerland, various projects have been launched in recent years to promote the work of women artists and to support them in their careers. From a \n to coaching programmes and street or social media activism, women are laying claim to the artistic landscape.\u00a0But the\u00a0slow pace comes as no surprise in a land where women were only granted the right to vote at a national level in 1971.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nAn Instagram account is tackling discrimination in the Swiss art scene. SWI swissinfo.ch met the people who are acting as Hulda Zwingli. \nSwitzerland is home to\u00a0many great artists, but until recently it was mostly men that gained worldwide attention. But little by little, Swiss women artists have also started to be recognised abroad, in important competitions\u00a0and museums. Even in Switzerland,\u00a0women who have been creating for decades are only now being noticed by their home country\u2019s institutions. For example, doyens Esther Eppstein and Vivian Suter\u00a0were the winners of this year\u2019s\u00a0Swiss Grand Award for Art (the Prix Meret Oppenheim).\nMore\n\n\n\n\nEsther Eppstein, the grande dame of the Zurich independent art scene, has won the Prix Meret Oppenheim 2021. \nMore\n\n\n\n\nVivian Suter explains how her decision to live in Guatemala, away from the art circus, has paid off. \nThe Bilanz artists ranking, a reference in the field, annually ranks the most interesting and internationally successful Swiss artists based on content and relevance rather than market value. In the latest (2021) edition\u00a0five women are in the top 10: Basel-born Miriam Cahn is top of the list, followed by Pipilotti Rist in second place, then Silvia B\u00e4chli (6\n), Pamela Rosenkranz (9\n) and Shirana Shahbazi\u00a0(10\n).\nUntil 2019 there was no empirical way of determining how visible, or invisible, women artists were\u00a0in the country\u2019s cultural institutions; the Federal Statistical Office did not have data on equality in art museums. SWI swissinfo.ch and Swiss public television RTS joined hands to fill the gap and published the first national survey on inequality in art institutions. Between 2008 and 2018, we found that only 26% of all solo exhibitions in Swiss art museums were dedicated to women.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nMale artists far outnumber their female counterparts in Swiss art museums, our research shows. \nThe struggle for women artists\u2019 recognition is also a worldwide issue. The Guerrilla Girls\u2019 protest at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York in 1984 \u2013 sparked by the exhibition \u201cAn International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture\u201d, in which 13 of 169 artists were women \u2013 is considered a milestone, but the fight has been going on much longer.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThis year Swiss museums are drawing attention to women artists and their work, many of whom have been forgotten over the years. \nIn its message on culture policy for 2021-2024, the Swiss government prioritised the promotion of gender equality in the cultural sector. For the moment, however,\u00a0financing allocated by the Federal Office of Culture to museums has no \u201cequality clause.\u201d The implementation of\u00a0temporary quotas to guarantee better balance of gender\u00a0has not managed to find consensus among the many actors in the cultural sector.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nArt by women isn\u2019t shown as often in Swiss art museums as art made by men. We brought together three generations of women to share their stories. \nGender inequality doesn\u2019t only concern art museums. A June 2021 study commissioned by the Pro Helvetia arts council revealed that across the cultural sector \u201cwomen are notably underrepresented, both at the level of strategic and artistic direction as well as on the stage and in exhibitions\u201d. The researchers looked at performance art (dance and theatre), music, literature, and visual arts, and found that numbers vary widely across disciplines.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nA study commissioned by Pro Helvetia finds women are lacking across much of the cultural sector, especially in music. \nArticles in this story\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

                "en_content": "Statistics show that numbers at Switzerland\u2019s\u00a0ten\u00a0universities and two prestigious institutes of technology actually rose by 4% in 2020 compared with 2019 \u201cdespite the crisis due to the Covid 19 pandemic and its impact on global mobility,\u201d according to \n by the Federal Statistical Office. \u201cFor 2021, initial estimates show trends similar to those of 2020,\u201d it said.\nIn 2020, higher education institutions were mainly impacted by a slight decrease in the number of non-European entrants, \u201cbut in many cases this was offset by an increase in the number of entrants from neighbouring countries,\u201d the statistical office said.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nInternational students are still coming to Switzerland \u2013 a popular destination for overseas students - despite the coronavirus pandemic. \nOverall, foreign students currently account for 31.4% of students at Swiss universities \u2013 compared with 19% in 1990/1.\u00a0\n\u201cGenerally, master rather than\u00a0bachelor\u00a0degrees are more appealing to foreign nationals who come to study in Switzerland,\u201d observes the stats office. But what foreign students really like are PhDs: they made up 57% of doctoral entrants in 2020/2021. This compares to an average of 25%\u00a0across\u00a0OECD countries.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0OECD\u2019s\u00a0Education\u00a0at a Glance\u00a02019\u00a0report\u00a0on Switzerland explains\u00a0why Swiss doctorates are so attractive: above-average spending on research and development, which \u201cin turn support the progress of doctoral students both during and after their study\u201d,\u00a0and\u00a0low tuition fees.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor example,\u00a0the\u00a02021/22\u00a0tuition\u00a0fee\u00a0at the top-ranked Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich)\u00a0is around\u00a0CHF1,500\u00a0($1,546) for all students (Swiss and non-Swiss, the university makes no distinction)\u00a0compared\u00a0with\u00a0an average $50,000+ annual tuition fees for foreign students for many top US universities.\u00a0(Although academic fees are low, the cost of living in Switzerland is not.)\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe US and UK are the top destinations for international students. Relatively low tuition fees could help Switzerland compete for the top brains. \nThe fact that Switzerland\u00a0doctoral students are employed\u00a0by the universities\u00a0and earn a wage, which reduces their financial burden,\u00a0is another factor,\u00a0the OECD says.\u00a0\u00a0\nForeign students\u2019\u00a0study\u00a0subjects of choice? Natural\u00a0sciences\u00a0and engineering.\u00a0\n\u201cStorming the ivory tower requires patience, confidence and a little help from someone who has already done it,\u201d according to\u00a0Arasan\u00a0MJ,\u00a0one of our Indian student bloggers,\u00a0who studied\u00a0for a\u00a0masters in finance\u00a0at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.\u00a0\nIn his case, speaking to someone in charge of the course before sending in an application was very useful as it helped gauge his admission chances.\u00a0\nSwiss admission requirements are relatively straightforward, but there can be a lot of\u00a0extra documents, such as a course transcript and personal essay, to submit as well.\nOne accepted, those\u00a0applying from\u00a0outside of most of Europe\u00a0also\u00a0need\u00a0to apply for\u00a0a visa and\u00a0then, once in Switzerland,\u00a0a residence permit from the canton\u00a0of residence.\u00a0\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, foreign students from EU/EFTA countries have been allowed into Switzerland, subject to the normal immigration rules and quarantine rules if necessary.\u00a0\nForeign students from third countries can be admitted for education and training courses that last for more than 90 days, provided they meet the\u00a0\n. More information \nAdditionally,\u00a0applicants\u00a0often\u00a0need to\u00a0prove\u00a0a good grasp of the\u00a0language\u00a0of instruction, be that\u00a0German, French or Italian.\u00a0For\u00a0a growing number of\u00a0graduate\u00a0progammes,\u00a0the language of instruction is English.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nShould you start planning your university admission strategy two years in advance? The process can be complicated for international students. \nOnce in, foreign students can\u00a0generally\u00a0expect\u00a0broad\u00a0support for settling into their university of choice, as well as for academic and future work issues,\u00a0our reporting over the last years and\u00a0our bloggers\u00a0suggest.\u00a0Help has been available for international students during the pandemic, with student organisations such as the Erasmus Student Network Switzerland stepping in with admin and settling-in support\u00a0where there are gaps.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nCan Swiss universities offer the kind of support and vibrant student life that attracts many to the US and UK? \nAccording to\u00a0Gaurav Singh,\u00a0another\u00a0one\u00a0of our\u00a0Indian student bloggers, academic life in Switzerland can be quite different to\u00a0life\u00a0back home, as he reported in a post before the pandemic. He appreciated the emphasis on the practical\u00a0\u2013\u00a0rather than the theoretical\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in his\u00a0masters\u00a0course\u00a0at the University of Neuch\u00e2tel, which was designed to prepare him for the job market.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut he was surprised at students calling their professors by their first name.\u00a0\u201cSeveral times my professors had drinks with us in\u00a0ap\u00e9ros\u00a0organised by university. It was so different from India, where you have to say either refer to your lecturer as \u201cSir\u201d or \u201cProfessor\u201d to your teacher. Socialising with them is unthinkable,\u201d\u00a0he observed.\u00a0\nAfter graduation, almost\u00a040% of foreign\u00a0graduates\u00a0leave the country, according\u00a0one-off\u00a0data released by\u00a0the\u00a0statistical office\u00a0in 2017.\u00a0Most of them\u00a0went\u00a0on to work in\u00a0a\u00a0neighbouring country.\u00a0\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nComplicated rules and immigration laws present obstacles for graduates of Swiss schools from outside the EU or EFTA. Will a legal change help? \nIt is generally easier for European graduates than those from elsewhere to find jobs in Switzerland. \u201cForeign graduates \u2013 especially those from outside the European Union \u2013 need to get used to rejection letters,\u201d as Fungai Mettler, originally from Zimbabwe, wrote in a pre-pandemic\u00a0opinion piece for swissinfo.ch. Although she did find that networking, blind applying for jobs and going the extra mile for these applications were key to her eventual success in finding a position.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nHow do foreign graduates from Swiss universities find jobs? Fungai Mettler from Zimbabwe gives tips on attracting employers' attention. \nA\u00a0recent\u00a0study\u00a0by the National\u00a0Centre\u00a0of Competence in Research\u00a0found the\u00a0so-called\u00a0priority rule, which institutionalises\u00a0a\u00a0preference to\u00a0Swiss,\u00a0EU\u00a0and\u00a0EFTA\u00a0(European Free Trade Association)\u00a0candidates,\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0free movement of people\u00a0accord\u00a0with the EU were the reason for the upper hand of European graduates in the Swiss job market.\u00a0\u00a0\nOverall, those\u00a0with degrees in STEM\u00a0\u2013\u00a0science, technology,\u00a0engineering\u00a0and maths\u00a0\u2013\u00a0were more likely to get a job, the study found.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe federal technology institute ETH Zurich has been ranked the eighth best university in the world in the QS World University Rankings 2022. \nArticles in this story\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

                    "The only thing that [Vladimir] Putin respects is\u00a0force and power. What we\u00a0really need to\u00a0do\u00a0is\u00a0to\u00a0stop dithering. We\u00a0have come a\u00a0long way since last February when Germany gave 5,000\u00a0helmets [to Ukraine]. But it\u2019s quite clear that without serious military support, the Ukrainians can\u2019t win. We\u00a0would have had massive destruction in\u00a0Kyiv if\u00a0the Ukrainians had not had Patriot missiles to\u00a0shoot down the missiles that were directed at\u00a0them. We\u00a0need firm support from the West. Here, again, the West has been playing the self-deterrence card. Putin makes threats about using nuclear weapons and then everyone says, \u2018Oh no, we\u00a0can\u2019t let the Ukrainians get more equipment\u2019. Then slowly the West realises that if\u00a0we\u00a0give them anti-tank missiles and the anti-missile missiles, then it\u00a0doesn\u2019t start World War Three. And more importantly, the West does not sufficiently realise that if\u00a0you do\u00a0not help Ukraine, then you can throw out the past 80\u00a0years of\u00a0international law, because basically Putin is\u00a0saying to\u00a0the civilised world:\u00a0\u2018I can invade and there are no\u00a0consequences.\u2019",
                    "I\u00a0don\u2019t think it\u00a0makes sense to\u00a0de-escalate right now. Because that means allowing Russia to\u00a0keep and\u00a0further strengthen the defense of\u00a0territory it has illegally occupied. I would say that we\u00a0need the opposite now \u2014 a\u00a0very strong push to\u00a0liberate occupied Ukrainian areas, especially as we\u00a0know that wherever they occupy territory they commit the most horrible war crimes. So when\u00a0I hear people saying, \u2018We\u00a0should de-escalate and have a\u00a0ceasefire\u2019, that\u2019s basically saying: \u2018Go\u00a0ahead, Russia, rape, kill, torture\u2019. So\u00a0de-escalation is\u00a0something you can say if\u00a0you\u2019re sitting in\u00a0a bath and having a\u00a0ros\u00e9. But we\u2019re talking about torture victims and rape victims.",
                    "What we\u00a0are seeing in\u00a0Europe is\u00a0a\u00a0division between countries that have experienced Soviet occupation and those that have not. In\u00a0this country, everybody has a\u00a0relative or\u00a0a\u00a0grandparent, someone who has suffered under Soviet Russian rule. People call the Estonian prime minister [Kaja Kallas] a\u00a0\u2018hawk\u2019. Her mother was six months old when [in\u00a01940] she was deported in\u00a0a\u00a0cattle car to\u00a0Siberia and was in\u00a0Siberia until she was seven years old, and only then came back to\u00a0Estonia. So we\u00a0have experience and this kind of patronising attitude of\u00a0people who have never gone through this, telling\u00a0us that we\u00a0don\u2019t know how to\u00a0deal with Russia, is\u00a0obnoxious. It\u2019s disgusting.",
                    "Well, I\u00a0mean the inability of\u00a0especially Westerners, European politicians to\u00a0understand what is\u00a0happening and discounting the experiences of\u00a0what people in\u00a0the East have gone through. This has bothered me\u00a0since I read a\u00a0review in\u00a0",

This is\u00a0the bizarre inability of\u00a0people to\u00a0look at\u00a0what happened. And you can be lectured for years by\u00a0Western politicians about how they know how to\u00a0get along with the Russians when they have had no\u00a0experience with the Russians.",

That affects everyone. The short-term problems for people here simply do\u00a0not matter when it\u00a0comes to\u00a0the war crimes being committed right now in Ukraine.",

We\u00a0would have had massive destruction in\u00a0Kyiv if\u00a0the Ukrainians had not had Patriot missiles to\u00a0shoot down the missiles that were directed at\u00a0them. We\u00a0need firm support from the West. Here, again, the West has been playing the self-deterrence card. Putin makes threats about using nuclear weapons and then everyone says, \u2018Oh no, we\u00a0can\u2019t let the Ukrainians get more equipment\u2019. Then slowly the West realises that if\u00a0we\u00a0give them anti-tank missiles and the anti-missile missiles, then it\u00a0doesn\u2019t start World War Three. And more importantly, the West does not sufficiently realise that if\u00a0you do\u00a0not help Ukraine, then you can throw out the past 80\u00a0years of\u00a0international law, because basically Putin is\u00a0saying to\u00a0the civilised world:\u00a0\u2018I can invade and there are no\u00a0consequences.\u2019\nI\u00a0don\u2019t think it\u00a0makes sense to\u00a0de-escalate right now. Because that means allowing Russia to\u00a0keep and\u00a0further strengthen the defense of\u00a0territory it has illegally occupied. I would say that we\u00a0need the opposite now \u2014 a\u00a0very strong push to\u00a0liberate occupied Ukrainian areas, especially as we\u00a0know that wherever they occupy territory they commit the most horrible war crimes. So when\u00a0I hear people saying, \u2018We\u00a0should de-escalate and have a\u00a0ceasefire\u2019, that\u2019s basically saying: \u2018Go\u00a0ahead, Russia, rape, kill, torture\u2019. So\u00a0de-escalation is\u00a0something you can say if\u00a0you\u2019re sitting in\u00a0a bath and having a\u00a0ros\u00e9. But we\u2019re talking about torture victims and rape victims.\nWhat we\u00a0are seeing in\u00a0Europe is\u00a0a\u00a0division between countries that have experienced Soviet occupation and those that have not. In\u00a0this country, everybody has a\u00a0relative or\u00a0a\u00a0grandparent, someone who has suffered under Soviet Russian rule. People call the Estonian prime minister [Kaja Kallas] a\u00a0\u2018hawk\u2019. Her mother was six months old when [in\u00a01940] she was deported in\u00a0a\u00a0cattle car to\u00a0Siberia and was in\u00a0Siberia until she was seven years old, and only then came back to\u00a0Estonia. So we\u00a0have experience and this kind of patronising attitude of\u00a0people who have never gone through this, telling\u00a0us that we\u00a0don\u2019t know how to\u00a0deal with Russia, is\u00a0obnoxious. It\u2019s disgusting.\nWell, I\u00a0mean the inability of\u00a0especially Westerners, European politicians to\u00a0understand what is\u00a0happening and discounting the experiences of\u00a0what people in\u00a0the East have gone through. This has bothered me\u00a0since I read a\u00a0review in\u00a0\n of\u00a0Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\u2019s \n. And the reviewer said: \u2018Oh, Solzhenitsyn doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about\u2019. This is\u00a0the bizarre inability of\u00a0people to\u00a0look at\u00a0what happened. And you can be lectured for years by\u00a0Western politicians about how they know how to\u00a0get along with the Russians when they have had no\u00a0experience with the Russians.\nWe\u2019re in\u00a0a\u00a0war. We\u00a0all make sacrifices in\u00a0a\u00a0war. We\u00a0pay\u00a0higher energy costs because we don\u2019t use Russian oil and gas. That affects everyone. The short-term problems for people here simply do\u00a0not matter when it\u00a0comes to\u00a0the war crimes being committed right now in Ukraine.\nThose exceptions are there already. That\u2019s not a\u00a0problem. As\u00a0you know there are no\u00a0restrictions on\u00a0humanitarian assistance. And that\u2019s always been there even during the Iranian sanctions.\nI\u00a0don\u2019t think Ukrainians who happen to\u00a0live in\u00a0Ukraine should be\u00a0impacted by\u00a0Russian war crimes. I\u00a0don\u2019t care about people who might be\u00a0inconvenienced by\u00a0sanctions when we\u00a0have war crimes ongoing in\u00a0Ukraine. And I\u00a0don\u2019t see those people protesting either. So\u00a0go\u00a0protest. Maybe it will change my\u00a0mind.\nYes, there are some people in\u00a0prison, but \n that support for war has increased [in Russia]. You still have the daughter\u00a0of [Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson Dmitry] Peskov who is\u00a0an\u00a0intern in\u00a0the European Parliament, t\n or \nbuying things for tens of\u00a0thousands of\u00a0euros because she\u2019s let in. Those things should not happen.\n:\nI really know nothing about Swiss banks doing business with Russia. But\u00a0I know that the Raiffeisen Bank in\u00a0Austria is\u00a0giving loans to\u00a0Russian soldiers. I\u00a0would basically sanction banks that assist Russia.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSeries Implementing Russian sanctions: Switzerland in the crosshairs\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

                "en_content": "Last month\u00a0Geneva-based thinktank\u00a0Inclusive Peace\u00a0published a \n that offers a possible path on how to negotiate peace in Ukraine. It is based on current and historical research, and what the track towards negotiations could look like.\nThe report comes as the war drags on to its 19\n month and has reached a near stalemate on the battlefield. On the ground -- and further afield -- casualties are mounting amid a global cost-of-living crisis due to disrupted food and energy markets. But while peace negotiations may not represent an option\u00a0for some, others say signs are emerging that their time may soon be ripe.\nIn August\u00a0an interview in the \n cited Thomas Greminger, the Swiss head of the Geneva Centre for Security Policy (GCSP), saying that Switzerland could encourage dialogue between Russia and Ukraine\u00a0without necessarily acting as an official mediator\u00a0and play a role in hosting any talks. He also said Western nations needed to consider other plans than indefinitely supplying Kyiv with military support\u00a0that would include Russia. Such a plan would include a ceasefire, followed by discussions on territorial claims, the ultimate political conundrum for both parties.\u00a0\nPierre-Alain Eltschinger, a Swiss foreign ministry spokesperson, wrote in an email to SWI swissinfo.ch that any mediation \u201cdepends\non the conflict parties\u00a0agreeing on a third mediating party\u201d.\nThe Centre of Humanitarian Dialogue (HD)\u00a0in Geneva, as well as the GCSP, have both been involved in \n, such as ahead of the grain deal which allowed for food and fertilisers to leave Ukrainian ports; they have kept channels of contact open with the two warring parties, in order to set the stage for any talks.\n\n\n\n\nAnalyst Daniel Warner looks at whether Russia\u2019s refusal to have Switzerland act as go-between with Ukraine marks the end of an era. \nWhile Turkey gained international clout from the role that it played in the grain deal, other countries in the Global South have also engaged as intermediaries between Russia and Ukraine. In June\u00a0an African peace mission led by South African president Cyril Ramaphosa that included representatives from seven other regional countries\u00a0headed to Moscow and Kyiv.\nDuring a press conference in June, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0told the visiting dignitaries that he would not negotiate as long as Russia continued to occupy Ukraine. Senegal\u2019s president Macky Sall responded by saying \u201cWe do understand, Mr. Zelensky, your position because your country is occupied, and for you, military action is a way out of the situation. But we are thinking that when you\u2019re fighting, you still probably need to have a place for a dialogue.\u201d\nAt the UN general assembly on Wednesday Zelenskyy pushed once again for his peace plan and met with Brazilian president Luiz Ignacio Lula to discuss a way out of the war. \u00a0\nBrazil, China, the United Arab Emirates and Israel have also expressed an interest to mediate\u00a0talks.\nPaffenholz describes the various types of signals we should be watching out for for negotiations to become a reality.\nRead more more on Ukraine, peace talks and Switzerland\nThania Paffenholz : Some experts say certain criteria are required for what they call ripeness for resolution. The most important is achieving a military stalemate on the battlefield. That is pretty much what we are seeing now. Military experts have predicted that the stalemate may last much longer than even this year, and may go way into next year. Another issue is fatigue in public attention and public support.\u00a0\nLast year\u00a0it was impossible to even talk about the likelihood of negotiations. The situation was so polarised, and anything other than a military solution was inconceivable. That has changed, with a number of initiatives, such as when Turkey began focusing on the Black Sea Grain Initiative. Sometimes things begin with something tangible like that before something more may come from it.\u00a0\nA number of discussions regarding mediating negotiations have also been made more recently by the Global South, by Brazil, South Africa, China, and by a delegation of African leaders. The Global South became suddenly involved due to their concerns over the rising cost of living.\u00a0\nAnother development that we are seeing is that President Zelensky is lobbying for his peace plan. Conversations began in \n, then went on in \n, Saudi Arabia, with the next round of conversations regarding the plan expected in autumn, to be hosted in Europe. These conversations may not get much media coverage, but they are proceeding.\u00a0\nT.P: The American presidential elections are certainly a key factor. If you talk about negotiations, you are clearly in the Republican camp. But some Democrats are also having thoughts and developing ideas about potential negotiations. It is difficult to address this because in Congress or for other decision makers\u00a0the issue has become so politically polarised.\u00a0\nImagine that the Republicans win the elections, and then they announce a plan to stop supplying arms to Ukraine. With the United States being the country\u2019s biggest weapons supplier, if the arms supplies stop, there will be moves. Often it is not so much the realities that determine what happens, but the perceptions. Already now, the perception is that if the Republicans win, there will be a massive shift of Western support that will definitely affect NATO\u2019s planning for military support. The closer we get to election campaigning, the more we may hear discussions about negotiations emerging alongside military engagement.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe brutality of the war in Ukraine is difficult to bear. Can those responsible be brought before a court? \nT.P: What is very normal in wars is that parties try to keep up fighting to make gains, especially when the conduciveness for potential negotiations is in the air. We usually see a rise in military activities as both sides seek to gain as much territory as possible to come equipped to the negotiation table. What we are also seeing here is that both sides are trying to keep up by getting more supplies, which also signals the military stalemate, as neither side is moving very much. From what we know, we are talking about tiny territorial gains and tiny losses.\u00a0\nWhere the Wagner Group now stands is a big question. Whether it implies a destabilisation of Russia is all guesswork, even for the analysts. The issue regarding Prigozhin\u2019s death is more of a concern to Africa for now, because Wagner is so powerful in Mali and other countries and entire governments relying on Wagner for their own security.\u00a0In Ukraine, Wagner troops are still there, but under which rule? Will they stay in Ukraine? I think that's a big question.\nT.P: What we suggest in the study is that because of the complexity of the war, we may see different negotiations on different topics take place, maybe even in different spaces. You may have conversations about the grain, others on the war\u2019s environmental destruction and what can be done, as well as discussions on rebuilding the country. You may have concerted conversations on integrity and sovereignty, and talks about security issues and a ceasefire. There will be all sorts of topics that will come up and will be shaped at the time. One could imagine that all of these different topics may have different actors involved in shaping the agenda and developing proposals.\nWithin the expert community that we are part of, institutions and governments like the Swiss government or various UN agencies may have a role within those particular thematic conversations. We don't see a big UN-led comprehensive peace process like in the past. This is interestingly in line with the UN Secretary General's new Agenda for Peace, where he spells out the new geopolitical dimensions and points to the fact that going forward, the UN will have a \n in discussions on difficult issues, as opposed to a leading role.\u00a0I think this is most probably what we will see here.\nArticles in this story\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

Arms companies could, for example, open joint ventures in Ukraine,\u201d he said.\nThis news story has been written and carefully fact-checked by an external editorial team.

The permanent Swiss population in Israel comprises about 28,000 people, Swiss Ambassador in Tel Aviv Urs Bucher told SRF News.\n\u201cThere are also a certain number of non-Swiss family members. At the moment, a few hundred businesspeople and tourists are estimated to be passing through,\u201d he said. Of those, 240 have already reported to the foreign ministry via the \u201cTravel Admin\u201d app. So far, there have not been any reports of Swiss coming to harm, he added.\nThe Swiss representations in Israel remained open over the weekend, the department said. It has also strengthened its teams and is closely monitoring the situation. Immediately after the attacks, the embassy in Tel Aviv inquired about the situation with liaison people, for example near the Gaza Strip or compatriots in the north and south, Bucher said.\nThese field offices served as a kind of \u201cantennae that then helped us to talk to our compatriots and give the right advice when needed\u201d.\n\u201cThe foreign ministry helpline as well as the Swiss Embassy in Tel Aviv and the representation office in Ramallah are operational and are answering the enquiries of Swiss citizens this weekend as well,\u201d says David Grichting, director of the foreign ministry\u2019s Consular Division.\nThe foreign ministry currently advises against all travel to Israel that is not of an urgent nature.\nFor people on the ground, it has three recommendations: they should follow the advice of the local authorities closely, read the foreign ministry\u2019s travel advice and latest information, and stay in touch with tour operators. \u201cIn case of emergency, the foreign ministry\u2019s hotline is available around the clock by phone and email.\u201d\nHere\u2019s how those affected can leave the country: \u201cThe foreign ministry is not currently planning any special flights,\u201d Grichting says. However, some airlines, including El Al and Ryanair, offer flights that make it possible to leave the country. However, many of these flights are probably already fully booked, he said.\nSWISS has announced a flight for Tuesday, according to the foreign ministry helpline. It will send a message to all those registered with the Swiss embassy in Tel Aviv and on the \u201cTravel Admin\u201d app, should the foreign ministry learn of special flights organised by partner countries from which Swiss nationals can benefit, Grichting added.\nThis news story has been written and carefully fact-checked by an external editorial team.

It will be difficult for Switzerland to play a role in such negotiations if Swiss law considers Hamas a terrorist organisation,\u201d he says.\u00a0\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

                    "In the wake of the Hamas attacks in Israel, Switzerland is considering naming the Palestinian militant group a terrorist organisation, in line with the European Union, Canada\u00a0and the United States. SWI spoke to Bocco to understand what that would mean for Switzerland and what role the Alpine nation could have in a peace process.\u202f\u202f\u00a0",
                    " Switzerland's previous engagement with Hamas, despite its global perception, allowed it to mediate previous conflicts and negotiations effectively due to its neutral stance. The shift towards declaring Hamas a terrorist organisation contradicts Switzerland's historical neutrality and mediating role. It potentially hampers its capacity to navigate and mediate future regional conflicts and negotiations, such as releasing hostages or facilitating dialogues between conflicting parties.\u202f\u202f\u00a0",
                    "R.B: Switzerland should leverage its traditional neutrality and play an intermediary role without siding with either Israel or Palestine. It's plausible to acknowledge that both parties may have committed war crimes, as seen in Hamas's actions and Israel's responses. Switzerland can provide valuable service by cautioning against potential intensifications, such as a land invasion by Israel in Gaza, while highlighting the risk of further escalating war crimes. But to execute this, the Swiss foreign ministry\u00a0must possess the requisite strength and resolve, which is a concern given its current perceived weakness.\u202f\u00a0",
                    "R.B: After the Oslo Accords in 1993 (signed between Israel\u202fand the\u202fPalestine Liberation Organization), Switzerland developed a cadre of diplomats who effectively engaged in Palestine. Today there is no longer that political will. There are fewer Swiss diplomats, and they are less well prepared. This poses a substantial problem for Switzerland's diplomatic endeavours in the region.\u202f\u00a0",
                    "R.B:\u202fGaza's population is over two\u00a0million, and the vast majority of them are refugees aided by UNRWA (the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East), funded in part by Switzerland. Thus, Switzerland should steadfastly support UNRWA, the only UN agency dedicated to assisting Palestinian refugees with humanitarian aid, unlike UNHCR, which mandates legal protection. It\u2019s crucial to note that the region\u2019s over six\u00a0million Palestinian refugees lack legal protection from any agency, making them uniquely vulnerable globally.\u202f\u00a0",

                    "R.B: Diplomatically, if Switzerland reduces humanitarian aid, it would be akin to \"committing suicide\".\u00a0On what basis would they halt humanitarian aid? Allegations that Hamas is diverting money destined for aid cannot be substantiated. The allocation of international assistance in Gaza has evolved into a sophisticated mechanism, ensuring thorough checks regarding the recipients and expenditure of the funds. The European Union, which contributes significant financial assistance, utilises a specific mechanism,\u202fcalled PEGASE, to ensure funds reach the intended associations and institutions. Therefore, while financial mismanagement may exist, any allegations should be supported with clear examples rather than propagating unverified claims.\u202f\u202f\u00a0",
                    "R.B:\u202fToday, a viable two-state scenario seems implausible. The current Israeli logic adheres to one state.\u202fFrom a legal perspective, Israel has formulated laws in its administration of the occupied territories that discriminate, separate\u00a0and displace the Palestinian people. The issue of racial discrimination in Israel has been increasingly prominent since 2017 when the UN published a report accusing Israel of apartheid on the Palestinian population.\u202f\u202f\u202f\u00a0",
                    "\u202fThe failure of the two-state solution, illustrated by the struggles of the Geneva Initiative [an initiative pushed by Israeli and Palestinian civil societies launched in 2003], suggests that alternative solutions, like a federalist model, warrant consideration.\u202f\u00a0Exploring new peacebuilding models like federalism hinges significantly on the willingness of involved parties to navigate through established political and territorial stances. This complex and multifaceted issue demands international and local engagement.\u202f\u00a0",
                    "R.B:\u202fVarious Palestinian and Israeli organisations are exploring alternative models. These include a \"one democratic state solution\", a \"bi-national state\" and a \"federation\". However, discussing these options in detail and moving towards any of them is currently challenging due to the ongoing war. It's essential to await the outcome of the present war to explore these options further.\u202f\u00a0",
                    "R.B:\u202fIt's about the juridical and constitutional architecture of the state. Israel, defining itself as a Jewish democratic state without a complete constitution, navigates delicate religious and political balances. A \"one democratic state\" would necessitate equal status for all citizens, both Jewish and Palestinian, and a defined constitution ensuring equal rights. In contrast, a \"bi-national state\" might provide different political structures for both national groups but needs careful planning to avoid internal conflicts and ensure equitable representation and rights for all. Exploring these models requires careful consideration of the diverse religious and political perspectives present in the region.\u202f\u00a0",
                    "A \"bi-national state,\" implies recognising the right to self-determination for both Israeli Jews and Palestinians, a point which, surprisingly, has never been officially declared. In its 2018 nation-state bill,\u202fIsrael declared that only Jewish Israelis have the right to self-determination.\u202fHowever, the right to self-determination was vital during decolonisation in other regions like Africa and India.\u202f\u00a0",
                    "R.B: Reflecting on past efforts, such as those following the Oslo Accords, there is a significant lesson about the importance of rigorous adherence and enforcement of international law in peacebuilding processes. Despite agreements, actions such as the substantial increase in land confiscation by Israel after 1994 occurred without significant international intervention or consequence. There was a failure from Europe and the United States to ensure that the involved parties adhered strictly to international law and norms. The substantial takeaway is holding entities accountable. They need to uphold legal and ethical standards by allowing neither geopolitical nor diplomatic relationships to soften the insistence on lawful and fair practices in international conflict resolution.\u202f\u00a0",

                "en_title": "\u2018Declaring Hamas a terrorist organisation contradicts Switzerland\u2019s neutrality\u2019",
                "en_content": "In the wake of the Hamas attacks in Israel, Switzerland is considering naming the Palestinian militant group a terrorist organisation, in line with the European Union, Canada\u00a0and the United States. SWI spoke to Bocco to understand what that would mean for Switzerland and what role the Alpine nation could have in a peace process.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n Switzerland's previous engagement with Hamas, despite its global perception, allowed it to mediate previous conflicts and negotiations effectively due to its neutral stance. The shift towards declaring Hamas a terrorist organisation contradicts Switzerland's historical neutrality and mediating role. It potentially hampers its capacity to navigate and mediate future regional conflicts and negotiations, such as releasing hostages or facilitating dialogues between conflicting parties.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nR.B: Switzerland should leverage its traditional neutrality and play an intermediary role without siding with either Israel or Palestine. It's plausible to acknowledge that both parties may have committed war crimes, as seen in Hamas's actions and Israel's responses. Switzerland can provide valuable service by cautioning against potential intensifications, such as a land invasion by Israel in Gaza, while highlighting the risk of further escalating war crimes. But to execute this, the Swiss foreign ministry\u00a0must possess the requisite strength and resolve, which is a concern given its current perceived weakness.\u202f\u00a0\nR.B: After the Oslo Accords in 1993 (signed between Israel\u202fand the\u202fPalestine Liberation Organization), Switzerland developed a cadre of diplomats who effectively engaged in Palestine. Today there is no longer that political will. There are fewer Swiss diplomats, and they are less well prepared. This poses a substantial problem for Switzerland's diplomatic endeavours in the region.\u202f\u00a0\nR.B:\u202fGaza's population is over two\u00a0million, and the vast majority of them are refugees aided by UNRWA (the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East), funded in part by Switzerland. Thus, Switzerland should steadfastly support UNRWA, the only UN agency dedicated to assisting Palestinian refugees with humanitarian aid, unlike UNHCR, which mandates legal protection. It\u2019s crucial to note that the region\u2019s over six\u00a0million Palestinian refugees lack legal protection from any agency, making them uniquely vulnerable globally.\u202f\u00a0\nUNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) and UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East) both deal with refugee-related issues but have distinct mandates and areas of operation, especially concerning Palestinians:\n\u2022 UNHCR: Established in 1950, its primary purpose is to protect and support refugees worldwide. It offers assistance to refugees, stateless persons, and, in some cases, internally displaced persons (IDPs) regardless of their nationality or origin.\n\u2022 UNRWA: Founded in 1949, its exclusive mandate is to provide assistance, protection, and advocacy specifically for Palestinian refugees who lost their homes and livelihoods due to the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict.\n\u2022 UNHCR: Operates globally in various countries affected by displacement.\n\u2022 UNRWA: Operates specifically in five areas: the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon\u00a0and Syria.\n\u2022 UNHCR: A refugee is someone who has been forced to flee their country because of persecution, war\u00a0or violence. The 1951 Refugee Convention provides the primary definition used by the UNHCR.\n\u2022 UNRWA: Uses a more specific definition. A Palestinian\u00a0refugee is a person \u201cwhose normal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict.\u201d\n\u2022 UNHCR: Provides legal protection, asylum-seeking procedures, camps, emergency response\u00a0and resettlement services.\n\u2022 UNRWA: Offers a broad range of services, including education, healthcare, social services, infrastructure and camp improvement, microfinance, and emergency response.\nR.B: Diplomatically, if Switzerland reduces humanitarian aid, it would be akin to \"committing suicide\".\u00a0On what basis would they halt humanitarian aid? Allegations that Hamas is diverting money destined for aid cannot be substantiated. The allocation of international assistance in Gaza has evolved into a sophisticated mechanism, ensuring thorough checks regarding the recipients and expenditure of the funds. The European Union, which contributes significant financial assistance, utilises a specific mechanism,\u202fcalled PEGASE, to ensure funds reach the intended associations and institutions. Therefore, while financial mismanagement may exist, any allegations should be supported with clear examples rather than propagating unverified claims.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nR.B:\u202fToday, a viable two-state scenario seems implausible. The current Israeli logic adheres to one state.\u202fFrom a legal perspective, Israel has formulated laws in its administration of the occupied territories that discriminate, separate\u00a0and displace the Palestinian people. The issue of racial discrimination in Israel has been increasingly prominent since 2017 when the UN published a report accusing Israel of apartheid on the Palestinian population.\u202f\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\u202fThe failure of the two-state solution, illustrated by the struggles of the Geneva Initiative [an initiative pushed by Israeli and Palestinian civil societies launched in 2003], suggests that alternative solutions, like a federalist model, warrant consideration.\u202f\u00a0Exploring new peacebuilding models like federalism hinges significantly on the willingness of involved parties to navigate through established political and territorial stances. This complex and multifaceted issue demands international and local engagement.\u202f\u00a0\nR.B:\u202fVarious Palestinian and Israeli organisations are exploring alternative models. These include a \"one democratic state solution\", a \"bi-national state\" and a \"federation\". However, discussing these options in detail and moving towards any of them is currently challenging due to the ongoing war. It's essential to await the outcome of the present war to explore these options further.\u202f\u00a0\nR.B:\u202fIt's about the juridical and constitutional architecture of the state. Israel, defining itself as a Jewish democratic state without a complete constitution, navigates delicate religious and political balances. A \"one democratic state\" would necessitate equal status for all citizens, both Jewish and Palestinian, and a defined constitution ensuring equal rights. In contrast, a \"bi-national state\" might provide different political structures for both national groups but needs careful planning to avoid internal conflicts and ensure equitable representation and rights for all. Exploring these models requires careful consideration of the diverse religious and political perspectives present in the region.\u202f\u00a0\nA \"bi-national state,\" implies recognising the right to self-determination for both Israeli Jews and Palestinians, a point which, surprisingly, has never been officially declared. In its 2018 nation-state bill,\u202fIsrael declared that only Jewish Israelis have the right to self-determination.\u202fHowever, the right to self-determination was vital during decolonisation in other regions like Africa and India.\u202f\u00a0\nR.B: Reflecting on past efforts, such as those following the Oslo Accords, there is a significant lesson about the importance of rigorous adherence and enforcement of international law in peacebuilding processes. Despite agreements, actions such as the substantial increase in land confiscation by Israel after 1994 occurred without significant international intervention or consequence. There was a failure from Europe and the United States to ensure that the involved parties adhered strictly to international law and norms. The substantial takeaway is holding entities accountable. They need to uphold legal and ethical standards by allowing neither geopolitical nor diplomatic relationships to soften the insistence on lawful and fair practices in international conflict resolution.\u202f\u00a0\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

They were responding to the call from the \u201cVoice for Freedom Coalition\u201d, an alliance comprising over 300 Christian Zionist organisations.\nSeveral speakers wearing black T-shirts emblasoned with the words \u201cSetThemFree\u201d took turns calling for the \u201cimmediate and unconditional release\u201d of the hostages. One of them insisted: \u201cWe will not be silent until the last one has been returned to his family\u201d. He called on the whole world to relay this appeal\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSeveral thousand people took to the streets in Lausanne on Thursday evening in support of Palestine. \nThe uncle of one of the hostages spoke of his nephew who was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7. \u201cA boy who worked as a waiter to afford a big trip, like all young people at 20. Like so many others, he was also at the Tribe of Nova festival.\u201d\n\u201cMy son was a sensitive boy, who played and composed music,\u201d recounted one mother. In tears, she detailed how she'd had him on the phone during the attack. \u201cHe was wounded in the arm. He was taken to Gaza. According to the Al-Jazeera channel, he would be dead today.\u201d\nAmong the Israeli flags and around the \u201cBroken Chair\u201d monument in front of the entrance to the Palais des Nations, many participants carried signs with photos of the missing. Speeches were punctuated by the slogan \u201cSet them free now\u201d.\nThe speakers appealed to the United Nations, the Red Cross and governments. They asked them to act in favor of the release of the 212 hostages held, according to Israeli sources. Many also invoked God and called for prayer.\nThe rally ended at around 4.45pm, to the sound of a Hebrew chant. The Geneva police, who counted some 600 participants, reported no incidents.\nThis news story has been written and carefully fact-checked by an external editorial team.

                "en_content": "Two collaborators of the Archives de l\u2019\u00c9tat de Fribourg, Lionel Dorthe and Rita Binz-Wohlhauser, have studied for six years the various registers and documents relating to 360 trials for witchcraft conducted from 1493 to 1741 by the court of the city of Fribourg. Already\nsince last year, these archives have recently been published in two volumes published by the\nof the Swiss Society of Jurists.\nThe interest of these documents exceeds the strictly local framework. \"Ultimately, the research focuses only on a specific period or event,\" said Lionel Dorthe. The filing of all witchcraft trials for such a long period is a first and can be used as a comparison point for other regions of the world. \u00bb\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe association of the Swiss archivists is one hundred years old, an opportunity to look into an unknown profession.\nThe general public often associates witchcraft trials with the Middle Ages and the Inquisition. But this vision is only partially correct. \u201cThe prejudice is to think that these persecutions date from the medieval era and that it is the Church who took care of it, while in fact it is a phenomenon of Ancien R\u00e9gime,\u201d says Lionel Dorthe. This is where the mass of trials in Europe and even in the United States takes place. And they are almost exclusively led by secular courts.\"\n\"The phenomenon of persecution appears at the beginning of the XV\ncentury, which is the last of the Middle Ages, recognizes the specialist. Demonology treaties were then drafted and the formation of a satanic sect hostile to Christian society began to be believed. At the base, it is indeed the Inquisition, most of the time led by Dominicans, which begins to hunt people for witchcraft.\" At the outset, the secular authorities will, however, quickly take things in hand and be quick to prosecute people for witchcraft crimes.\nThe magnitude of the phenomenon varies. Taking into account a few registers that have disappeared and encompassing trials in the bailiwicks, a total of 1,000 trials in 250 years for the whole canton of Fribourg, on average four per year, which is not a mass phenomenon. But in the Pays de Vaud, there are 3,000 trials for the same period.\n\u201cAll regions of Europe have not experienced the same intensity,\u201d says Lionel Dorthe. In areas where power was poorly assured, such as the Pays de Vaud under Bernese domination, judges used their powers in the fight against witchcraft. It\u2019s typical: the less power we have, the more we use it. But in areas where power was stronger, such as Fribourg or France, there was no competition in relation to judicial prerogatives and witchcraft trials were not political weapons. \u00bb\nThe Friburg archives show that a witchcraft charge could reach almost anyone. \"There are, of course, people who correspond to the clich\u00e9: an elderly woman who lives alone and who practises guerrillas,\" says Lionel Dorthe. But we can't clear a typical profile; We also find men and even children. Social origin is also diverse, for example, with a ch\u00e2telain judge in a bailiwick who himself conducted witchcraft trials. \u00bb\nIn such a context, the specialists avoid the term \"hair to witches\", because the phenomenon also affects men in one third of cases. But also because the term \"shock\" refers to a voluntary and targeted action by the authorities. \u201cBut the phenomenon is more complex, notes the archivist. Without the participation of the population, a parent or a neighbour and without faith in the devil and magic, the building collapses. \u00bb\n\u201cThe witchcraft charge is an excuse to explain the misfortunes of time or personal misfortunes,\u201d he continues. An ideal way to get rid of a neighbor we don\u2019t like or a mother-in-law too intrusive. If a young child dies, we try to find the person responsible, especially if the person is midwife or healer. If a farmer sees a sharp decline in the yield of his cows, he will also look for a bouc-\u00e9missaire. In Freiburg, where the dairy industry is important, neighbours are regularly accused of using magic formulas to \u2018leave the milk\u2019 of cows and bring it into the pits of their own beasts.\u201d\nThe public often associates with witchcraft trials of torture and death scenes on a lumber. This vision is not false, but if the justice of the time is hard, it is not necessarily blind.\nJudges use torture, but not systematically. Moreover, it is only a tool. \"The torture exists to help the course of justice,\" recalls Lionel Dorthe. We must avoid anachronism by placing our emotions and beliefs on those of the past. Judges must not be considered sadistic. They must do their work and the laws of the time allow them to use torture to unravel languages.\u201d\nDeath is not necessarily at the end of the path. In the majority of cases (40%), the proceedings are terminated by an external ban award \u2013 the convicted person must leave the canton \u2013 or in the interior \u2013 it is confined to his parish and the prohibition to leave. The death penalty is imposed in less than one third (30%) of the trials.\nFor witchcraft crimes, death occurs by fire, on a lumber. In half of the 80 executions listed in Fribourg, the penalty is \u201cmittered\u201d, i.e. softened. To prevent the condemned person from dying by the action of the flames, it is first strangled. It also happens that we place a small bag of cannon powder around her neck so that it explodes before burning.\nToday, persecution for witchcraft crime is presented as a phenomenon affecting exclusively women. But this representation is not supported by the archives. \"The feminist figure of the witch does not correspond at all to historical sources,\" said Lionel Dorthe. This idea that the witch was an independent woman who hated patriarchy is false. \u00bb\n\"This feminization of the phenomenon finds its origin in\n, an essay by Jules Michelet, he continues. This French historian of the XIX\ncentury transformed the witch into an ideal or idealized victim, into a figure of struggle against any authority. This image corresponds more to the very romantic aspirations of the XIX\ncentury only to historical facts. Many feminists have taken up this image of the emancipated or emancipating witch in the 1960s. \u00bb\nBut this recovery does not hit the specialist further measured. \"As a scientist, we will find this scandalous process, because it does not correspond to reality. But in relation to the effectiveness of the speech we want to have today, it is probably more sensible to use a symbol than to make a great speech. We live in a society where emotion now prevails over reason, especially because of social networks. Using an almost familiar figure like the witch is therefore effective, even if this figure is very far from historical reality. \u00bb\nMore\n\nThe use of anti-Semitic explanations during crises has lasted for centuries. Switzerland also has a long history in this area.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

This major event of Helvetic political life is, however, obliterated by a majority of the electorate and has little interest in the media and the academic world beyond national borders.\nOtherwise, Zo\u00e9 Kergomard says. This French historian perfectly mastering the language of Goethe has plunged into\nand made rich discoveries there.\nZo\u00e9 Kergomard: It is inherent in the functioning of the Helvetic political system, marked by federalism and the instruments of direct democracy. It is felt that it is not at that time that the destiny of the country is played, but rather during popular voting. What struck me, with my look as a French researcher in Switzerland, is that even here there is no strong interest in these elections.\nYet, these electoral campaigns are a special moment in the democratic life of the country during which political parties are staging and trying to create a connection with citizens. Unlike popular voting on a clear question, parties here have a blank page to highlight the ideas that interest them.\nThis gives a snapshot of the political debate in the country. But above all, when a party puts on the agenda a specific issue \u2013 the protection of the environment from the 1960s already, immigration, especially since the 1980s, etc. \u2013 it can have long-term effects on the media and political agenda.\nIf we take the case of France, we are still facing a democracy that is not going very well, as we have seen this year with the tensions around the reform of pensions. While participation is still quite high in the presidential election, it declines in all the other elections because citizens are no longer aware of it. This is the reverse of the medal of the hyper-presidentialization of the Fifth Republic.\nIn Switzerland, given the large number of votes, abstention is usually intermittent: many citizens vote when the subject of the voting interests them. If the rise of abstention in the 1960s-1970s had been debated at the time, since then, the relatively low electoral participation in Switzerland has been almost normalized and is generally not considered as a sign of democratic disaffection.\nStill, there is a matter that is regularly a matter of concern to the question of participation: who can be involved in Swiss political life and who remains excluded from it?\nThe proposal to extend political rights to young people over the age of sixteen has been on the table for some years. In addition, Swiss electoral campaigns show the peculiarity of a country with high immigration, where almost a quarter of the population does not have the right to vote at the federal level, as a result of a naturalization policy among the most restrictive in Europe. There too, this issue gives rise to regular debate.\nWherever we are on this issue, we may think that this exclusion has consequences on political participation in general. In places of sociability such as work or associations, there is a need for less policy if a more or less important part of the group cannot participate.\nIt is one of the paradoxes of Swiss political life: politics is very visible in the public space, but major political debates are not necessarily present in the daily interactions of the population.\nPolitical parties, which do not receive state funding, are historically weak in Switzerland, particularly in comparison with the largest interest groups. It was said that this weak party and the militia system lead to unprofessional campaigns.\nBut behind the parties, economic associations have played a role for a long time both in the voting campaigns and in the electoral campaigns. In addition, the open list system encourages candidates to invest in their own campaign.\nThis diversity of actors involved in electoral campaigns has long made it difficult to accurately assess campaign spending. For the first time this year, new rules on transparency in political financing will apply to federal elections. It will be very interesting to study the benefits.\nIndeed, it is a striking contrast with the 1940-1980s. However, there are more variations in voices between politically close parties than from one bloc to another. Especially since the partisan system is particularly diverse in Switzerland, as can be seen with the existence of two ecologist parties, one more critical, the other more favorable to the market economy.\nThe campaign practices used by the UDC are not unpublished. Since the 1950s, parties began to work more or less closely with probe and advertising. And there are strong continuity in mobilization practices: parties have been using posters since the 1920s to be visible in the public space.\nThe controversy of UDC campaigns is also not new. In 1979, for example, the Radical Party had carried out a campaign called \u201cAmerican\u201d around the neoliberal slogan \u201cmore freedom, less states\u201d. And during the cold war, anti-communism, very strong in Switzerland, has often been used to stigmatize left-wing parties.\nPersonal attacks also punctuate the history of federal elections. Following the introduction of female suffrage at the federal level in 1971, the first female candidates were the subject of gender-based denigratations in the press or anonymous letters calling for their names to be removed.\nSpeeches about the culture of the \"consensus\" certainly have a moderating effect on the behaviours of political actors. In 2007, both the use of violence and the xenophobic outbursements of the UDC campaign in question were condemned.\nSuch incidents are not unique, particularly in the turbulent context of protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Young apprentices and apprentices from the Hydra group, accompanied by Italian workers, had, for example, disrupted an electoral meeting of the far-right James Schwarzenbach Triune in 1971, claiming a place in Swiss democracy.\nIn short, the Swiss electoral campaigns have often been much more enlivened than we can imagine, and put at stake major democratic issues: who participates, who represents who, what political problems will be priority in the coming years.\nMore\n\nIn comparison to other countries, Switzerland is distinguished by its legendary stability. How does she explain?\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

After its breakthrough in the last federal elections, the party could even go under the 10% mark, losing 3.5 percentage points. In parallel, the other ecologist formation, the Green Liberal Party (PVL / centre), is also losing speed.\nIf this decline is confirmed, the Greens will probably have to give up their ambition to win a seat in the government. Political formation was expected to wait for the results of the elections before deciding whether or not to attack the seat of socialist minister resigning from the Interior Alain Berset.\nLa La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La\ndefinitely belongs to the past. A trend that corresponds to that observed in the European Union. After their success in the last European elections, environmentalists are also at pain in the EU. They are falling in the surveys in France and Germany and are unable to impose themselves in other member countries.\nIn the losers' camp four years ago, the conservative right has, on the other hand, the stern wind in Confederation. The Democratic Union of the Centre (UDC), the country\u2019s first political force, is preparing on Sunday to achieve the second highest score in its history. The party is credited by more than 28% of the vote by\nfrom the Sotomo Research Institute, as shown in the chart below.\nThis success is also part of a European context where the conservative right is advancing, making breakthroughs in different countries. This is notably the case in Italy with the arrival in power of Giorgia Meloni and his far-right party Fratelli d\u2019Italia. In Sweden too, a block composed of the right and the far right won the last elections. Last example: Finland, where the populist movement of the Finns joined the government last April.\nHowever, the Swiss Parliament should only operate a moderate right turn. On the one hand, it will be mitigated by the probable gains of the Socialist Party (PS), estimated at 1.5 percentage points, the left party recovering much of the votes lost by the Greens. On the other hand, the decline of the Radical Liberal Party (PLR / right), down one point, should contain the growth of the bourgeois camp.\nThe trainings that had lost the elections in 2019 should be the winners of the legislative 2023, are the political experts of the Sotomo Institute. Four years ago, the small parties had pulled their pins off the game. This year, the big ones should lead the ball again. An exception to this trend: the PLR which should charge losses for the second consecutive time.\nThe elbow between the PLR and the Centre, almost equally in the last polls, is also one of the major issues of these elections. If the Centre ended up delighting the country's third political force in the PLR, it would represent a historical upheaval. The composition of the Federal Council could thus be questioned, since the principle of concordance provides that the three largest parties in the country have two seats in the government and the fourth, one.\nThe election campaign took place without great brilliance. The parties put on their favorite theme, without too much dare to venture on the platforms of their opponents. L\u2019\na massive increase in the costs of compulsory health insurance, on September 26, revived the debates on this issue. The subject is even the one that would have the most influence on the October 22 elections, according to various polls. This benefited the PS, which focused its campaign on purchasing power.\nThe increase in migration pressure at the borders of Europe, on the other hand, played in favour of the UDC, which made this topic its trade fund. A strategy that seems to have once again reached its target, as immigration is one of the main concerns of Switzerland, as the polls have shown. It also has an important influence on their voting decisions.\nWhile extreme climate events are growing and global warming continues to be prominent on the list of population concerns, the Green-e-s does not seem to have been able to take advantage of this. \u201cThe theme mobilizes less the electorate.

It is based on the number of people who consider the elections to be very important for the future of the country, down in the last poll.\nThe results of the election to the National Council, elected to the proportional system, are expected on Sunday at the end of the evening. Elections to the Council of States are held almost everywhere in the majority system.

                "en_content": "Political ecology is no longer a recipe in Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe. The defeat of the Greens and the Greens reflects the difficulties faced by environmental parties in the European Union. In fall in the polls, they should also suffer a setback in the European elections of June 2024.\nDuring the electoral campaign in 2019, the theme had dominated the public debate and led to a great mobilization on the left of the political scale, especially with the organization of climate strikes. This was not the case this year.\nThe trend seems paradoxical, at a time when extreme climate events are growing and climate change remains one of the main concerns of Switzerland. The fact that it is hot in October, however, is not the first concern of the population, a growing part of which is struggling to curb its ends of months. And the climate can also create a sense of impotence within the electorate.\nIn the end, environmental formations have not succeeded in making climate change \u201csexy\u201d. On the contrary, they have suffered the fisting of radical climate activists, who provoke incomprehension or anger among a large part of the population.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe big UDC winner and the backward ecologists in the federal elections on Sunday, according to the first national projection. Our follow-up.\nThe images of the Italian island of Lampedusa, confronted with a large influx of migrant people from North Africa, have toured the world and handed asylum policy to the forefront during this election year. A fall for the UDC, which focused most of its campaign on its predilection theme, the fight against immigration.\nWith the increase in asylum requests (12'188 between early January and late June, or +43% compared to 2022), in addition to the presence of 65,000 refugees from Ukraine, the UDPC was able to capitalize on the growing concerns of some of the population.\nDrawing on its posters and all-houses the spectrum of a Swiss population of 10 million inhabitants and inhabitants, the UDC did not in the shade, attracting itself\nof the Federal Commission against Racism. However, this very clear speech had a mobilising effect at the party base during this period of international insecurity.\nThe UDPC also found in Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, the new socialist minister in charge of immigration, an ideal scapegoat. This winning tactic, which has already been experienced several times in the past, allows the UDC to erase its defeat of 2019 and to get closer this Sunday to its record level of 2015.\nUnder the slogan \u201cclosed, but just\u201d, the Liberal-radical Party (PLR / right) also made migration policy one of its priority themes during the electoral campaign. Contrary to the UDC, the PLR stressed the need to maintain the free movement of people to attract a qualified European workforce, while hammering out a struggle against the\n.\nWith this stance and surprisingly virulent attacks on Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, the PLR did not want to leave the field free to the right isolationist on this theme. However, voters and voters have clearly given more credibility to the solutions proposed by the UDC.\nIn this period of full employment, the PLR could not count on another strong mobilising theme. As for the bad management of Credit Suisse, bought by its rival UBS, it certainly helped to preter the image of the liberal-radicaux, historically very linked to the Swiss financial position.\nResult: the founding party of modern Switzerland stagnates in these elections and fails to reverse the downward trend over the long term. While it was still attracting nearly a quarter of the electorate in the early 1980s, the PLR now only convinces a little more than one in 7.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland renews its Parliament on 22 October 2023. Projections and partial results.\nFor its election campaign 2023, the Socialist Party came back to its bases: the struggle for the purchasing power of households. The return of inflation and the announcement of a new substantial increase in health insurance premiums just a month before the federal elections put social themes at the heart of the issues. The PS was able to recover a few votes to the Green-e-s in the camp on the left.\nBut while health insurance premiums are again the first issue of concern to the Swiss, in front of immigration, the PS has, in the end, only marginally benefited from discontent among some of the middle-class voters and voters.\nUnlike the UDC on the issue of immigration and the Greens on the issue of global warming, the Socialist Party is not necessarily considered the most competent political force in the complex area of health insurance.\nIn a country that puts a lot on individual freedom, proposals for a single sick body and income-based premiums are considered to be an excessive stateization by the majority of electors and electors. The PS is certainly a prophet in the left, but still struggling to recruit beyond its traditional lands.\nAlthough everything is not upset, it is a historic moment of Swiss policy: The Centre is at the elbow with the PLR as the third political force in the country. Based on the final results in both houses, he would mathematically be entitled to a second seat on the Federal Council. This is what the magic formula that has been practiced since 1959, according to which the three largest parties each hold two seats in the Swiss government, and the fourth is a seat.\nShould the Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis, a red lantern in the ranking of the popularity of federal advisors, then tremble for his mandate? Rather not, since another principle is that members of the Federal Council should not be dismissed; this unwritten rule has only been breached three times in the last 175 years.\nThe CDP, of which Le Centre is the emanation, has benefited from it itself four years ago, when the Green-e-s just passed it in number of votes. In 2021, the PDC merged with the PBD under the new name of the Centre and recovered the accounts.\nOne thing is for sure: in the current constellation, the Centre will show itself even more enterprising and establish itself as the undisputed political force at the centre of the political chess. Under the leadership of his president Gerhard Pfister, he got rid of his past proverbial discretion. At the National Council, there is still an important coalition partner of the PLR and the UDC, who have no majority of them. In the Council of States, it should remain the most important force.\nSwitzerland, a model democracy, is tired of politics. This is how the rate of participation in these elections could be analysed. With almost 47%, participation in these elections is certainly slightly higher than in 2019 (45 1%). But as always over the past few decades, more than half of the voters and voters have not gone to the polls. This is a time when crises continue to succeed throughout the world and purchasing power is decreasing in Switzerland.\nHow can we explain this silence of the majority of the electorate? The main cause of abstention may be found in the inertia inherent in the Swiss system. When a party wins 3%, it is almost considered a political earthquake. However, force relationships remain almost always unchanged. A fortiori to the government, a bastion of stability.\nAnd if Parliament, whether it is a little more on the left or a little more on the right, would find it unpleasant to make a decision, abstentionists believe that they could call it back to order by referendum.\nThe electoral campaign has remained far from the costs of political brilliance or anthology passes from weapons that are observed abroad. The parties carried out their program by relying on their favourite subjects, without too encroaching on the platforms of their opponents. There was also no real substantive debate on the major political themes of the moment. The fall of Credit Suisse and relations with the European Union were absent from the campaign.\nHowever, this is not an exception, but rather the rule in peaceful Switzerland. Apart from the 2015 immigration debates and in 2011 following the Fukushima nuclear accident, campaigns are often fades. A characteristic inherent in Helvetic direct democracy: federal popular vote taking place four times a year, parties benefit from many other opportunities to explain their positions on different topics.\nHowever, as every four years, this election campaign allowed parties to create a connection with citizens. Each candidate had to give his person and tighten hundreds or even thousands of hands to hope to keep or conquer a seat in Bern. A very rare and precious moment, including in a Helvetic democracy often erected as a model of proximity between the people and their representatives.\nMore than 220,000 Swiss abroad are registered on an electoral register. More and more expatriates return to the country one day. In this sense, it is legitimate that they participate in voting and elections.\nThis electorate is growing rapidly: it has more than tripled over the past 30 years and has reached a size that would theoretically allow it to occupy six seats on the National Council. The parties therefore increasingly argue the voices of the Swiss abroad. The PS, the UDC, the PLR and the Centre have long been active in the diaspora and have international sections. These have already allowed some candidates to obtain the necessary votes in the past.\nThe Liberal Green Party is the last of the six major parties to have created an international section for these elections. A choice dictated by the fact that the political profile of the Swiss abroad corresponds largely to that of the last born of the Helvetic parties: they are on average progressive on the ecological level, defend a liberal society and an open foreign policy.\nAs the Swiss abroad vote more according to values, they may also be more faithful to a party. In this election year, they have been the subject of many interventions in Parliament. There was even a real final sprint to win their favors.\nMore\n\nHow can Switzerland ensure that its citizens and citizens abroad are treated no less well than those living in the country?\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

A l\u2019\u00e9tranger, c\u2019est lui qui obtient les gains les plus marqu\u00e9s (+2,8 points, de 17,6% \u00e0 20,4% de part \u00e9lectorale).\u00a0",
                    "Le principal changement dans le vote des Suisses r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger en 2023 semble ainsi \u00eatre un report sur le Parti socialiste des voix qui \u00e9taient all\u00e9es aux Vert-e-s en 2019.\u00a0",
                    "Faut-il alors en conclure que les Vert-e-s ont perdu la confiance de la population expatri\u00e9e? \u00abJe ne pense pas que les Vert-e-s aient fait quelque chose de mal\u00bb, estime Martina Mousson. \u00abEn g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les partis de droite ont davantage de chances de tirer leur \u00e9pingle du jeu dans des situations mondiales incertaines\u00bb, explique-t-elle.

                    "En revanche, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui s\u2019observe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale, on ne peut pas dire que l\u2019UDC ait triomph\u00e9 dans les urnes du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des Suisses expatri\u00e9-es.\u00a0",
                    "Le parti de droite conservatrice, premi\u00e8re force politique du pays, qui a aussi connu la plus forte progression cette ann\u00e9e (+9 si\u00e8ges et 28,6% des voix, en hausse de 3 points), r\u00e9alise \u00e9galement une hausse au-del\u00e0 des fronti\u00e8res helv\u00e9tiques, mais plus mod\u00e9r\u00e9e: de 18% \u00e0 18,5% des voix de la diaspora.\u00a0",
                    "L\u2019UDC reste la deuxi\u00e8me force politique chez les Suisses de l\u2019\u00e9tranger, mais avec des scores qui restent nettement plus bas que ceux r\u00e9alis\u00e9s au niveau national.",
                    "La question de savoir si l'UDC peut franchir la barre des 30% se pose r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement en Suisse. \u00abElle s'en approche toujours, mais n'y est jamais parvenue, rel\u00e8ve Martina Mousson. Il existe manifestement un plafond pour l'UDC, tant en Suisse qu\u2019\u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger\u00bb. Seul l\u2019avenir dira \u00e0 quel point cela est grav\u00e9 dans le marbre.\u00a0",
                    "L\u2019\u00e9lectorat suisse de l\u2019\u00e9tranger est traditionnellement plus lib\u00e9ral et plus \u00e0 gauche que le reste du pays. \u00abCe n'est pas nouveau, c'est pourquoi je ne suis pas surprise que la progression de l'UDC n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plus importante\u00bb hors des fronti\u00e8res, commente la sp\u00e9cialiste.\u00a0",
                    "Dans l\u2019ensemble, la mani\u00e8re dont la diaspora a vot\u00e9 pour ces l\u00e9gislatives tend \u00e0 confirmer cette tendance. A eux deux, les principaux partis de gauche (PS et Vert-e-s) ont recueilli pr\u00e8s de 39% des votes (contre 27% pour l\u2019ensemble de la Suisse); la force additionn\u00e9e des partis \u00e9cologistes (Vert-e-s et Parti vert\u2019lib\u00e9ral) s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 30% \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger (contre 17% en Suisse).\u00a0",
                    "Pour les autres partis, les scores restent relativement stables. Le Centre gagne 0,9 point, une hausse proche de celle r\u00e9alis\u00e9e au niveau national (+0,8 point). Pour le parti lib\u00e9ral-radical \u00e9galement, l\u2019\u00e9volution est sensiblement la m\u00eame au sein de l\u2019\u00e9lectorat expatri\u00e9 que pour le reste de la Suisse: la formation de droite perd 0,6 point (contre 0,7 dans l\u2019ensemble du pays).\u00a0",
                    "La participation des Suisses de l\u2019\u00e9tranger est comme souvent rest\u00e9e faible: elle s\u2019est \u00e9lev\u00e9e dans l\u2019ensemble \u00e0 18,7%, en baisse dans quasiment tous les cantons \u00e0 l\u2019exception de B\u00e2le-Ville et Saint-Gall.

Ce bon r\u00e9sultat par rapport aux autres Suisses de l'\u00e9tranger peut s\u2019expliquer par le fait que son nom figurait sur la liste principale des hommes socialistes bernois.

                "en_content": "One of the main lessons learned in the federal elections that took place on Sunday is that the green wave, which had characterized the 2019 legislatures, belongs to the past. At the national level, environmental parties suffered a real camouflet.\nWith 9.4% of the vote, the Greens dropped by 3.8 points and lost 5 seats on the National Council (the Lower House of Parliament). Only the other ecologist party, the Green Liberal Party, is further downwards in terms of terms of terms of office (-6 seats and a decline of 0.6 points on the electoral side, which stands at 7.2%).\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland renewed its Parliament on 22 October 2023. All the results.\nThe Swiss who live abroad also voted massively less for the Greens this year. In all of the twelve cantons that provide separate statistics on the diaspora vote, the ecologist party loses 5.4 points of election share, moving first in 2019 (to 23.8% of the vote) to third position this year (to 18.4%).\nAnd this, although the Fifth Switzerland traditionally voted more in favour of the climate than the rest of the country, as was the case in the last popular vote on this topic. According to Martina Mousson, a political scientist at the Gfs.bern Institute, the decline of the Greens is linked to the current context, both abroad and Switzerland.\nDuring these elections, the situation was fundamentally different from that of four years ago. \"Although the climate issue remains one of the main concerns of Switzerland, it was obviously not a relevant issue for the elections and was overshadowed by other global themes,\" such as the war in Ukraine, the economic situation or inflation, says Martina Mousson. \u201cSwitzerland is not the only one concerned,\u201d notes the political scientist.\nAt the national level, the Socialist Party achieved the second highest progress behind the UDC (+1.2 point, at 18% of the vote). On the other hand, he obtained the most marked gains (+2.8 points, from 17.6% to 20.4% of the election share).\nThe main change in the vote of the Swiss residing abroad in 2023 seems to be a postponement to the Socialist Party of the votes that had gone to the Greens in 2019.\nShould we then conclude that the Greens lost the confidence of the expatriated population? \"I don't think the Greens did something wrong,\" says Martina Mousson. \"In general, right-wing parties are more likely to shoot their pins in uncertain global situations,\" she explains. For the political scientist, the environmentalists were probably victims of the global situation this year, while they had benefited four years ago.\nOn the other hand, contrary to what is observed at the national level, it cannot be said that the UDC has triumphed in the ballot boxes on the expatriate Swiss side.\nThe conservative right-wing party, the country's first political force, which also experienced the strongest increase this year (+9 seats and 28.6% of the vote, up 3 points), also achieved an increase beyond the Swiss borders, but more moderate: from 18% to 18.5% of the diaspora's voices.\nThe UDC remains the second political force in the Swiss abroad, but with scores that remain significantly lower than those achieved at the national level.\nThe question of whether the UDC can cross the 30% bar is regularly raised in Switzerland. \"She's always approaching, but has never been there,\" said Martina Mousson. There is obviously a ceiling for the UDC, both in Switzerland and abroad.\" Only the future will tell how high it is in marble.\nThe Swiss electorate from abroad is traditionally more liberal and left-handed than the rest of the country. \"This is not new, which is why I am not surprised that the progression of the UDC has not been more important\" outside the borders, the specialist comments.\nOverall, the way in which the diaspora voted for these laws tends to confirm this trend. Both of them, the main left-wing parties (PS and Vert-e-s) collected nearly 39% of the votes (compared to 27% for Switzerland as a whole); the combined force of the ecologist parties (Vert-e-s and Green Party) is 30% abroad (compared to 17% in Switzerland).\nFor other parties, scores remain relatively stable. The Centre earns 0.9 points, an increase close to the national level (+0.8 points). For the liberal-radical party also, the evolution is substantially the same within the expatriate electorate as for the rest of Switzerland: the right-wing formation loses 0.6 points (compared to 0.7 in the whole country).\nThe participation of the Swiss from abroad has often remained low: it has risen overall to 18.7%, down in almost all the cantons with the exception of Basel-Ville and Saint-Gall. At the national level, however, it rose slightly from 2019, from 45.1% to 46.6%.\n43 Swiss abroad were present for these federal elections. Unsurprisingly, none of these applications has transformed the trial. However, the results of two members of the diaspora are different.\nThe foreign candidate who obtained the most votes is Pascal Cuttat, from Nairobi, in the canton of Bern. No less than 12\u2019451 Bernese and Bernese voted for this 61-year-old socialist who works at the Swiss Red Cross. This good result compared to other Swiss abroad can be explained by the fact that its name was on the main list of Bernese socialist men. Pascal Cuttat does however the least good result of his list.\nIn Geneva, the Green Rudolf Berli won an esteem success. With 11'947 votes, he arrived in fourth position in the list of the cantonal ecologists. Pugny's garden (France) won 4271 votes in Geneva alone and 999 votes abroad.\nThe last election of a foreign national advisor was Tim Guldimann\u2019s for the PS in the canton of Zurich. He obtained a brilliant result in 2015 by collecting 102'757 votes. He was then not the first Swiss national to sit in Parliament, but the first to be elected while living abroad. Tim Guldimann resigned in 2018, arguing that it was difficult to \"live in an environment and make politics in another environment.\"\nIn fact, the Swiss abroad are unlikely to be elected, says Ariane Rustichelli, Director of the Organisation of Foreign Switzerland (OSE). \"The Guldimann case was quite exceptional,\" she said.\nOSE has a working group that supports direct representation in Parliament. The demand is recurring, but for the time being it has never been successful, since the Constitution should be amended.\nMore\n\nHow can Switzerland ensure that its citizens and citizens abroad are treated no less well than those living in the country?\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

This is the most important issue when it comes to choosing a party, just in the face of rising health insurance premiums and climate change. This is what the post-election analysis conducted by the Sotomo Institute shows.\nThe overwhelming majority of the electorate of the UDC (74%) also voted on this party because of its migration policy, according to the poll. The conservative right managed to create a monopoly on this issue, since no other party convinced a majority of its troops on the subject. On the other hand, the independence and sovereignty of the country, which was also discussed by the UDC, represented decisive arguments only for 21% electives and voters of the conservative right party.\nGreat loser of this election Sunday, the Green-e-s did not succeed in creating the same enthusiasm around climate policy. Although their electorate was almost exclusively motivated by this issue, other parties also benefited. Many people also voted for the Socialist Party (PS) because of its programme to combat climate change. In addition, the PS has been more convinced of social issues, such as health insurance premiums or social security.\nWith its strategy, the UDC has thus succeeded in conquering and mobilizing new voters from all parties, reveals the post-election analysis. Conversely, the Green-e-s saw a part of their electorate to almost all the other formations, with the exception of the Radical Liberal Party (PLR / right). More than half of the losses of the environmental party benefited the PS, but it also lost some ground in favor of the UDC, the Centre and the Green Liberal Party.\nThe post-election survey on the legislative elections of 22 October 2023 was conducted by the Sotomo Research Institute, on the mandate of the Swiss Broadcasting and Television Corporation (SSR, part swissinfo.ch). The data was collected between 21 October and 23 October. 23 207 electors participated in the survey, on the one hand on the SSR Internet portals, on the other hand on the Sotomo website. The margin of error is +/- 1.2 percentage point.\nSotomo's politicologists also analyzed the reasons why some people have changed sides during these federal legislation. Nearly one-third of these were not satisfied with the way in which their former training addressed the increase in health insurance premiums. This benefited mainly from the PS, but also from the Centre. A quarter of these people disagreed with their party\u2019s migration policy, of which more than half joined the UDPC.\nThe debates around gender and wokism are most often cited as a trigger to choose another party, as well as polarization of political debates. A large part of these people decided to vote for the Centre, shows the survey.\nThe new Parliament is now slightly more to the right and less green. However, the Swiss people seem to rely on it to achieve the energy transition: 46% of the electorate considers that this is a priority, highlights the Sotomo Institute.\n\u201cThis theme is no longer exclusively reserved for the Greens,\u201d says Sotomo, Sarah B\u00fctikofer. It notes that the vote on the climate law, accepted by the people last June, has proved that all parties recognize that Switzerland must take care of the energy supply and implement the necessary changes.\nShe recalls that the Greens were the first to talk about the energy transition several decades ago, but believes that their position is today the majority. \"It is no longer necessary to vote green if one wishes that someone in Parliament agrees on this theme,\" analyses the political scientist.\nDespite the slip on the right of Parliament, social demands have not disappeared either. The priority of the electorate is directly related to its purse: 66% of voters consider that the newly elected legislature must find solutions to limit the increase in health costs and health insurance premiums.\nToday, the people seem to trust the right to resolve these social issues. What is not paradoxical in the eyes of Sara B\u00fctikofer. She recalled that the UDC was largely mobilized in groups of people with lower incomes. \u201cAfter the hardening of the right to asylum, it is the second priority of the party,\u201d she said.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nHere are the main lessons to be learned from this election Sunday.

In anticipation of the results of the OIOS investigation due at the end of November, Switzerland maintains the suspension of its contributions to UNRWA\u2019s projects: \u201cDFAE supports UNRWA\u2019s reforms, which should lead to good governance of the aid organization and effective use of funds. UNRWA is a key player in stability and security in the Middle East. This helps to improve the prospects of Palestinian refugees.\nDuring a trip to Jordan last year, the head of the DFAE had questioned the usefulness of the UN agency, believing that it was part of the problem rather than its solution. Ignazio Cassis had also suggested that Bern could further assist the institutions of the States hosting Palestinian refugees rather than UNRWA.

In Hamas schools. Is that what Mr. Cassis wants?\"\nThat is not the wish of the United Nations. \"The Secretary General (Antonio Guterres) reaffirms his support for UNRWA's excellent work, essential for the well-being of Palestinian refugees. It is vital at this moment that Member States and other partners remain involved in UNRWA and in the services it provides,\" said UN spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric.\nThe moment is indeed critical. The UN General Assembly will soon renew for three years the mandate of UNRWA, despite the strong opposition of the United States and Israel.\nAt the request of the Swiss Parliament, the Federal Council will present its own report on UNRWA's \"cooperation, efficiency and transparency\".\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

As the Commissioner-General of the UN agency since April, this former ICRC delegate succeeded Pierre Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, who was forced to resign in 2019 following charges on his way of management. This crisis, like the interrogations of Ignazio Cassis on the usefulness of UNRWA, seems to belong to the past.\nThe Swiss government\nfor 2021-2022 the same level\nin previous years, 20 million francs per year. Bern adds 1 million francs to the programme set up to deal with the pandemic. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DFAE) will also support the reforms undertaken by the institution and the international conference to be held by UNRWA next spring to sustain its future.\nGood news, while the United Nations agency in charge of Palestinian refugees in the Middle East is still uninsured to be able to pay the salaries for this end of the year to its 30,000 employees. What is to put at risk the schools, health centres and social services that UNRWA maintains in its camps.\nPhilippe Lazzarini: We are in an exceptional and dangerous situation that the agency has never known in its entire history. It is comparable to an aircraft that will soon have to operate an emergency landing to avoid the crash.\nThis liquidity crisis adds anxiety to a region already under tension, including the effects of the Covid-19, which reinforces the despair of Palestinian refugees in the face of a future that seems to be overwhelmed. These budgetary problems happen at the worst: faced with ever-growing needs, we have never been so weakened financially.\nIt has been months since I announced that the agency will no longer be able to maintain its services. We're there. Since November 9, we have no cash left to pay for the salaries of November and December.\nThe objective of my calls is to maintain all the activities and teams necessary for the operation of schools for more than half a million girls and boys, our health centres in the middle of this Covid-19 pandemic, and minimal social services in the face of an abject level of poverty in the region. If by the end of the month, I have no information from donors, I will have to resolve to make decisions that will have an impact on our services. This will certainly create a panic among already desperate refugees.\nWidely. Our exchanges took place well, including budget. Bern supports our reform agenda, which is at the heart of UNRWA\u2019s strategy for the coming years. And I was also able to speak with a series of parliamentarians concerned with our action and the situation in the Middle East.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nIs the head of Swiss diplomacy annoying or is it launching a test balloon to reorient Swiss diplomacy in the Middle East?\nIn my opinion, the page is turned. This is the information I receive from donors and member States. The team that was in place last year was replaced. Many reforms have been put in place to ensure more efficient, transparent and team-friendly management. I am totally involved in the pursuit and deepening of these changes. And the echoes I receive from our partners show that trust is being fully restored.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nUNRWA's Commissioner General resigned. Switzerland has explained this on the Swiss public television (RTS).\nThe current funding model is not tenable. Year after year, the gap continues to grow between the cost of services we provide and the resources available. The political support we obtain is poorly translated financially.\nThat is why we will call for an international conference for next spring. We will present the strategy of the coming years with the aim of ensuring the contributions of member States and above all promoting commitments over several years to allow us to have a little more predictability in the organization of our actions.\nThe quotas of the Member States cover only the management structure of the organization, which is 150 out of the 30\u2019000 employees of the UN agency.\nThe regular budget for 2020 is more than $800 million, in addition to three emergency programmes, which represent a total of approximately $500 million. About half of each\nhave been funded to date.\nEstablished by the United Nations in 1949, after the First Arab-Israeli War, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)\n) today stands at 5.8 million Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank.\nThe agency hosts 711 schools that now host more than half a million children. It manages 144 health centres attended by 3.6 million Palestinian refugees. UNRWA also provides support to some 270,000 refugees in the form of targeted food or monetary aid.\nCommissioner-General of UNRWA since March 2020, Philippe Lazzarini is one of the highest Swiss personalities in the United Nations.\nI also expect that friendly countries such as Switzerland will help us to obtain this support from member States so that UNRWA can re-appropriate the objectives and strategy of its mission.\nIn fact, the agency is mandated to deliver quasi-state services: education, care and social services for a population of 5.8 million people. But we do not have any of the revenue opportunities that governments have, be it taxes or loans. We depend on these voluntary contributions that are today at an extremely low level, comparable to 2012, while since then, the region has gone through multiple crises that have led to a significant increase in needs.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nUNRWA spokesman, Tamara Alrifai highlights the challenges of international aid for the reconstruction of a Lebanon on the edge of the abyss.\nThe United States has been an important partner of the agency in recent decades. I hope this partnership will resume when the new administration is in place. In recent years, we have maintained contacts with members of the congress, Senate and administration at the field level. And the information we receive today indicates a willingness to resume this partnership. It remains to be known when and how much.\nI recently visited the Gulf countries, especially to assess the impact of these new political developments. Every time, my interlocutors assured me that they would maintain their commitment in the coming years. But for the regular budget of 2020, this commitment has still not materialized. I am hopeful that it will be realized by the end of the year, as well as on the medium term and at our international conference next spring.\nOur action is social and humanitarian. But it deploys in a highly politicized context. I remain convinced that it is not in the interest of anyone in this region to see the instability in the Palestinian camps, whether in Lebanon, Gaza, East Jerusalem or the West Bank. If UNRWA was to be perceived as unable to fulfil its mandate because of a lack of resources, it could only fuel the feeling that it had been abandoned by the international community. In such a volatile region, it is an additional despair that must be avoided at all costs.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "en_title": "Switzerland abandons the Geneva Initiative, but for what alternative?",
                "en_content": "The Geneva Initiative, signed in October 2003 between two former ministers, one Israeli and one Palestinian, and under the leadership of Alexis Keller, a Swiss university, was to be if it is not\na final solution to the Middle East conflict at least a first step towards a comprehensive resolution.\nShe was \u201cthe first initiative of the genre that proposed something concrete to resolve the Middle East conflict\u201d, recalls Mohamed Ch\u00e9rif, former correspondent in Geneva of swissinfo.ch who had covered the event.\n2003 is the year in which the United States invades Iraq. It is also the year when the second Palestinian intifada is at its peak. This movement of violence in which Palestinians face Israeli soldiers with stones and suicide attacks begins after the failure of Camp David\u2019s agreements in 2000. Israel bombs the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and the West Bank in the country. A total of 3,000 to 5,000 deaths will be deplored on the Palestinian side and 1000 on the Israeli side.\nAlexis Keller also remembers the optimism that had welcomed the initiative, whose idea had emerged in Geneva in 2001 before being concluded in Amman, Jordan, two and a half years later. \u201cThere was an atmosphere of mutual respect and recognition between the two sides, with a real joy and a feeling of writing history,\u201d he says.\nHowever, twenty after the signing, it is important to note that the Geneva Initiative has had no impact on the ground: the Israeli settlements are slipping and the two countries are anchored in a wrought conflict that causes death almost daily. Switzerland announced that it would no longer fund the Initiative after 2023.\nThis decision is surprising in the eyes of Alexis Keller, who explains that \u201cthis text remains the most successful model of the two-state solution, especially since the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAE) has not announced any concrete alternative\u201d.\nThe Geneva Initiative is primarily the work of Geneva-based academic Alexis Keller and his father, former diplomat and banker. Both are committed personally and financially to the negotiation process that often takes place in the family chalet, in the Bernese Alps, starting in January 2001.\nAlmost two years later, on 12 October 2003, efforts resulted in a text of nearly 100 pages signed by former Minister Yossi Beilin and a Palestinian counterpart, Yasser Abed Rabbo, Jordan.\nThe Geneva Initiative provides for major concessions from both sides and addresses all substantive issues of the conflict: the status of Jerusalem, the fate of Palestinian refugees and the borderline.\nIt was drafted by members of Israeli and Palestinian civil society. The text was distributed to the homes of both camps. He was supported by former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and former President of the United States, Jimmy Carter.\nThe Israeli government was firmly opposed to this text, and some circles criticized what they saw as a \u201cinterference\u201d of Switzerland in Israeli affairs.\nThe Geneva Initiative is not the first attempt to anchor peace between Israel and the Palestinian territories. There were the Oslo Accords 1 and 2, in 1993 and 1995, the Camp David Agreement (July 2000) and a peace plan presented by the then American President, Bill Clinton (December 2000).\nThe Geneva initiative is distinguished by its desire to address in a single document the differences between the two protagonists: the status of Jerusalem, the evacuation of almost all of the West Bank of Jewish settlers, and the compensation of Palestinian refugees.\nIt was supposed to be a first step to put around the table the then Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, and the leader of the Palestinian authority, Yasser Arafat. What is innovative in the approach is that it is drafted by members of Israeli and Palestinian civil society, and not negotiated by heads of state.\n\"She addresses front issues immediately, then integrating results into a broader process,\" said Alexis Keller at the launch.\nBut backwards, one can wonder if she was not simply scheduled to fail. The Initiative never gave rise to a great civil solidarity movement as the signatories wanted.\nSwiss diplomacy was divided, Ariel Sharon never intended to validate it and Yasser Arafat supported it from the lips.\nFor Alexis Keller, three reasons can explain this failure: \u201cSwiss had not made enough commitment, as Norway did with the Oslo Accords. There was also the strong rejection by Israel and the lack of support from the Arab countries.\"\nIn Switzerland too, the initiative divided from its beginnings. It was pushed by Micheline Calmy-Rey, a member of the Socialist Party and then head of the DFAE. She herself was isolated within the government. She has never obtained a parliamentary majority to support her approach.\nThis shy support from Switzerland, which has also declined over time -\n- led to a lack of willingness to implement on site.\nAccording to an expert who collaborates on projects with the DFAE and prefers to remain anonymous, the Initiative demonstrates \u201cthe naivety and lack of knowledge of the local dynamics that dominate the Middle East\u201d. The text appeared on civil society and on a relay of Israeli and Palestinian public opinion that never took place.\nA new evaluation of the Initiative by Switzerland in 2020 concluded that its effectiveness had declined due to its lack of political support in Israel and Palestine. In January 2022,\n.\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs then announced a new strategy for the promotion of peace and development in the Middle East and North Africa that will take over in 2023. Bern also plans to move the headquarters of the Swiss cooperation in Jerusalem to Ramallah, as required by the Israelis.\nSwitzerland insists that the final end of the Initiative does not sign its disengagement from the region. The Confederation will continue to spend CHF 1.8 million per year for the promotion of peace and human rights. \u201cThe search for a political solution to the conflict in the Middle East is a priority of the Federal Council\u2019s MENA (Moyen Orient and North Africa) 2021-2024 strategy,\u201d says Andreas Heller, DFAE Spokesperson:\nIn addition, Switzerland has created a new post to \u201cpromote concrete solutions in the region\u201d, with the appointment of a Swiss Envoy for the Middle East. This special envoy will not replace regional ambassadors on site.\nA policy widely criticized by experts and NGOs, which criticize Switzerland for a change in its foreign policy in the region. The decision to transfer the Jerusalem cooperation office to Ramallah can be \u201cinterpreted as an implicit recognition of the annexation of East Jerusalem by the State of Israel\u201d, says Nago Humbert, founder of M\u00e9decins du monde Suisse.\nThe statement of Ignazio Cassis, then Minister of Foreign Affairs, on a trip to the region in 2018, goes in the same direction when he says to the press: \u201cAs Arabs are not ready to grant Israel the right to exist, Israel feels threatened in its existence and will defend itself.\u201d\nFor Alexis Keller, Switzerland\u2019s current policy in the Middle East \u201cmasks the opacity of Swiss foreign policy, because if Switzerland puts on humanitarian aid and development assistance, it returns to what it was doing before the Geneva Initiative, or not to make politics in a region where everything is political\u201d.\nMore\n\nIn its relations with the European Union, Switzerland is playing a dangerous game of balancing, which could also come out losing.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

I have no memory of seeing such a population movement under such extreme conditions in recent history.\u201d\n\u201cIn addition to the offensive announced by Israel, the situation is extremely critical in Gaza,\u201d he said. Water supplies resumed last Sunday in southern Gaza, after being cut for seven days by the Israeli government. At the beginning of last week, he had ordered the stopping of the water, electricity and fuel supply of this territory which depends on its supply.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provided \u201cfuel at water distribution stations\u201d and \u201cestablished water reserves for some 250,000 people,\u201d said Fabrizio Carboni.\nDespite the Israeli government\u2019s order to move to Gaza, all populations did not leave the north of the Gaza Strip. But they must not become enemies, we must continue to protect them, said Fabrizio Carboni. \"There are hospitals, sick, elderly, people who don't want to let go of their homes. All these people are protected. They are entitled to receive the minimum vital to stay where they are. Even if they don't move, they don't suddenly become military objectives. \u00bb\n\"It must be very clear to everyone,\" he adds. I think we need to find spaces inside the Gaza Strip to protect these people.\u201d\nOn Thursday, the ICRC representative expressed his fear that \"without electricity, hospitals are turning into morgues,\" after having been in contact with health professionals on the spot and his colleagues in the Palestinian Red Crescent.\n\u201cI think we are in extreme situations where doctors try to do the best with what they have, but what they have is increasingly reduced. So unfortunately we move slowly towards this scenario,\" said Fabrizio Carboni.\nOn Tuesday evening, a hospital in the city of Gaza was hit by a strike that killed more than 500 people, according to Hamas, who accuses Israel of being at the origin of the attack. Tel Aviv denied all responsibility and attributed the raid to the Islamic Jihad. He denied his involvement.\nOn Monday, Fabrizio Carboni stressed the importance of ensuring free movement in the territory of the Gaza Strip to be able to meet the needs of the population. \u201cIt\u2019s no good to have food, water, medical logistics if you can\u2019t move inside. What we need is to be able to work in acceptable security conditions, which is not the case today.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to be able to urgently bring humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip,\u201d he said.\nNo humanitarian aid has been able to enter the Gaza Strip from Egypt by the Rafah border post, which was closed on Wednesday. Hundreds of trucks, including UN agencies, carrying food, water and medicines are waiting on the Egyptian side.\nAn Israeli land operation could have terrible consequences on the civilian population, fears the ICRC. \"With the experiences in Mosul (Irak) and Aleppo (Syria) in particular, it is well known that urban conflicts are devastating to the civilian population. They are extremely murderous, violent and have a devastating impact on the essential infrastructure: those to supply water and electricity are generally destroyed. So our first concern is the human cost of this military operation in urban areas,\" said Fabrizio Carboni.\nThe Battle of Mosul, which lasted from 2016 to 2017, reportedly caused the death of approximately 10,000 civilians and that of Aleppo, from 2012 to 2016, would have caused that of at least 21,500 civilians.\nIn order to protect the population, humanitarian actors, namely \"the Palestinian Red Crescent, the members of the Movement, the United Nations, all the organizations present, the local organizations\", act together,\" added Fabrizio Carboni.\nRegarding the Israeli hostages of Hamas, the Geneva organization said that it had confidential discussions with Hamas to request their release as soon as possible. \"They are at high risk and a great danger,\" said Fabrizio Carboni. On Saturday, all parties were contacted to ask them to ensure the safety of these people as soon as possible.\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t ask that they be treated well. But also that they contact their families and that they are released under no condition, he said.

But above all, he's dirty because we lied about him...\" insists investigative journalist Marie Maurisse. With Fran\u00e7ois Pilet in the Gotham City collective, they worked for several months to dig six white-collar crime files. Six stories of scams, drug traffickers, criminals, terrorists, who a priori have nothing in common. To one detail: all have passed by Swiss banks to whiten their dirty money.\nFrom this investigative work, they draw an unpublished podcast, co-produced by swissinfo.ch and Europe 1 Studio, which tells how Switzerland has become, over the decades, the \u201cunfortunate\u201d of scams from all over the world, far from the image we can have, once locked by bank secrecy.\nIn the first episode, direction New York in the early 20th century, where a certain Meyer Lansky grows, the man who a few years later will develop an innovative financial system to whiten the dirty money of the mafia, Cosa Nostra. Its connection with Switzerland: suitcase carriers, known as \"p\u00e8lerins\" that give it access to the backyard of a Swiss bank and its accounts that carry numbers, for more discretion.\n\u201cDangerous millions\u201d is a co-produced podcast by SWI swissinfo.ch, the online information service of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (a public media) and Europe 1 Studio, with Gotham City journalists.\nSeveral witnesses agreed to tell from the inside these cases, often unknown as we speak of millions and millions who have evaporated in nature. For example, former magistrate Carla Del Ponte testifies to his experience in Russia, in the footsteps of a public works company very close to power. Xavier Justo tells him his 547 days in detention in a prison in Asia, for having been involved in a huge case of embezzlement of public funds.\n\"The main difficulty in our work is the people on which we investigate and their lawyers, who have enormous means to make us fold,\" says Marie Maurisse. \"I don't see myself as a white knight or as a journalist without fear and reproach, who goes to denounce the wicked. The most important thing for me is transparency and public interest. Who are as important in a common law case as in a financial crimes case.\"\nMore\n\nImmigration is one of the solutions to the shortage of skilled labour.

                "en_content": "After several years of pandemic, the Swiss hotel industry has recovered completely. As a backbone of tourism, the industry generates annual revenues of around 8.5 billion francs and employs 75'000 people.\nWith more than 38 million overnight stays (3.8% above the record value of 2019), the year 2022 had already been a time of recovery. This year there is a new high-level operation and everything indicates that a new record is set up.\nIn this favourable environment, swissinfo.ch Andreas Z\u00fcllig met the president of\n, the umbrella organisation of the industry. The interview was conducted at the Hotel Schweizerhof in Lenzerheide in the canton of Graub\u00fcnden, where Z\u00fcllig is a host and director.\nIn our canton, tourism is very important, 50% of our exports are generated by this industry. This is due in particular to our position as an interface between southern and northern Europe. In addition, our canton has benefited from pioneers, for example in hotel and mountain railways.\nOur greatest challenges are the high costs and the lack of qualified workers. Fortunately, the problems with the hotel reservation platform Booking.com have been solved by changing the law. The old conditions had forbidden hotels to offer more attractive prices when booking directly.\nAndreas Z\u00fcllig developed his passion for the hotel industry in young years as he grew up in the hotel business of his parents. After his training as a chef, he worked in this profession and attended courses at the Hotelfachschule in Lausanne (EHL).\nToday he is \"hosts\", owner and director of\nin the Lenzerheide (Graub\u00fcnden), each together with his wife. Andreas Z\u00fcllig has been President of HotellerieSuisse since 2014.\nIt is also active in the management bodies of several alliances and national organisations, including the Economic Association of Economics and the Swiss Trade Association.\nThe origins of the customers: they depend heavily on the region. For example, the Titlis attracts many Indians, while the Virgin is very popular with Chines.\nIn general, I observe that American tourists are increasingly interested in Switzerland, which I see very positive due to the cultural proximity between the USA and our country. For Asian, Arabic or Indian tourists, the situation is more complicated.\nToo many very large tourist groups from countries with very different cultures lead to tensions with the local population. Lucerne and Lauterbrunnen have recently been affected by this phenomenon. Luckily, there are no cruise ships in Switzerland that are equivalent to over tourism.\nQuality is always preferable to quantity. A stabilizing factor is clearly the fact that almost half of our clientele comes from the country and is therefore hardly dependent on exchange rates.\nMore\nDebates\nPlaces like Venice or Barcelona \u2013 but also destinations in the Swiss Alps \u2013 have trouble with the many tourists: inside. What can you do?\nIt is generally excellent. We have schools of world call like the EHL in Lausanne. The dual training also works very well, especially in German Switzerland.\nThey vary depending on the region and even more depending on the season. In winter, for example, eastern Switzerland is in direct competition with Austria.\nIn summer, the competition comes mainly from southern Europe. In urban tourism we compete with destinations such as Paris or Vienna.\nIn urban tourism, Switzerland competes with destinations such as Paris or Vienna. \u00bb\nIt is a source of great joy that foreign companies recognize the potential of Swiss hotels.\nIn addition, it is positive to see that this investor is starting the renovation of true jewels from the pioneering period of tourism such as the Hotel Schweizerhof in Bern or the Hotel B\u00fcrgenstock above Lake Lucerne.\nWe take these situations seriously, but if there is a very high demand, high prices are absolutely normal. This phenomenon is universal and everywhere in the world.\nAs far as the Davoser Forum is concerned, the WEF controls prices for almost all hotels. These prices are high, but they move within a reasonable framework.\nThe few hotels or apartments that are not under the control of the WEF sometimes require exorbitant prices and unfortunately the press focuses on these exceptions.\nOn the contrary, our system is very reliable and, in addition, we have a good degree of harmonisation with our European colleagues. In fact, our classification applies to 80% of overnight stays and all large hotels have taken over them.\nThey are essential, mainly in the Federal Council and in the national parliament.\nThe framework conditions for our industry are still very good, especially in European comparison: Our labour market is liberal, regulatory requirements are low and cooperation with the social partners works well.\nIn addition, social charges and taxes are appropriate. It is important to maintain these good conditions.\nI'm extremely optimistic. In the last few months we have set up new records. In addition, our industry has become very resilient throughout the crisis.\nMore\n\nImmigration could be a major part of the shortage of skilled workers. But the issue is political smoothness.\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "content": [
                    "Zwei Mitarbeitende des Staatsarchiv Fribourg, Lionel Dorthe und Rita Binz-Wohlhauser, haben w\u00e4hrend sechs Jahren die verschiedenen Register und Dokumenten von 360 Hexenprozessen untersucht, die zwischen 1493 und 1741 vor dem Gericht der Stadt Fribourg verhandelt wurden. Das Archiv, das seit letztem Jahr online zug\u00e4nglich ist, wurde nun in zwei B\u00e4nden von der Rechtsquellenstiftung des Schweizerischen Juristenvereins herausgegeben.",
                    "Das Interesse an diesen Dokumenten geht \u00fcber den lokalen Rahmen hinaus. \"Normalerweise beschr\u00e4nken sich die Nachforschungen auf einen ganz bestimmten Zeitraum oder ein ganz bestimmtes Ereignis\", h\u00e4lt Lionel Dorthe fest. Alle Hexenprozesse \u00fcber einen so langen Zeitraum dokumentiert zu haben, sei eine Premiere und k\u00f6nne als Vergleichsmassstab f\u00fcr andere Regionen der Welt dienen.",
                    "In der \u00d6ffentlichkeit werden Hexenprozesse oft mit dem Mittelalter und der Inquisition in Verbindung gebracht. Das ist aber nur teilweise richtig. \"Es besteht das Vorurteil, dass diese Verfolgungen aus dem Mittelalter stammen und dass die Kirche sich darum gek\u00fcmmert hat, aber in Wirklichkeit handelt es sich um ein Ph\u00e4nomen w\u00e4hrend des Ancien R\u00e9gimes\", sagt Dorthe. Im Zeitraum vom\u00a016. bis 18. Jahrhundert h\u00e4tten die meisten Prozesse in Europa und sogar in den USA stattgefunden. \"Und sie wurden fast ausschliesslich von weltlichen Gerichten gef\u00fchrt.\"",
                    "\"Das Ph\u00e4nomen der Verfolgung taucht zwar zu Beginn des 15. Jahrhunderts auf, dem letzten des Mittelalters\", r\u00e4umt der Experte ein. Damals seien d\u00e4monologische Abhandlungen verfasst worden und man habe begonnen, an die Bildung einer satanischen Sekte zu glauben, die der christlichen Gesellschaft feindlich gesinnt gewesen sei. \"An der Basis war es tats\u00e4chlich die Inquisition, die meist von Dominikanern geleitet wurde, die begonnen hatte, Menschen wegen Hexerei zu verfolgen.\"",
                    "Die weltlichen Obrigkeiten, die von Anfang an in den Prozess involviert waren, \u00fcbernahmen jedoch bald das Ruder und waren schnell bereit, Menschen wegen Hexerei anzuklagen.",
                    "Das Ausmass des Ph\u00e4nomens ist unterschiedlich. Wenn man einige verschwundene Register ber\u00fccksichtigt und die Prozesse in den Vogteien einbezieht, kommt man f\u00fcr den gesamten Kanton Fribourg auf rund 1000 Prozesse in 250 Jahren. Das waren durchschnittlich vier pro Jahr, was kein Massenph\u00e4nomen darstellt. Im Kanton Waadt waren es im gleichen Zeitraum 3000 Prozesse.",
                    "\"Die Intensit\u00e4t war nicht in allen Regionen Europas gleich\", best\u00e4tigt Dorthe. Wo die Macht nicht gesichert gewesen sei, wie etwa im Waadtland unter bernischer Herrschaft, nutzten die Richter ihre Kompetenzen im Kampf gegen die Hexerei. \"Es ist typisch: Je weniger Macht man hatte, desto mehr nutzte man sie\", so Dorthe. Aber in Regionen mit mehr Macht, wie Fribourg oder Frankreich, habe es keine Konkurrenz um die Vorrechte der Justiz gegeben und die Hexenprozesse seien keine politischen Waffen gewesen.",
                    "Die Fribourger Archive zeigen, dass eine Anklage wegen Hexerei fast jeden treffen konnte. \"Nat\u00fcrlich gab es Personen, die dem Klischee entsprachen: Etwa eine \u00e4ltere Frau, die allein lebte und als Heilerin arbeitete\", sagt Dorthe. Aber es habe kein typisches Profil gegeben. Es traf auch M\u00e4nner und sogar Kinder. \"Auch die soziale Herkunft war vielf\u00e4ltig: So gab es einen Schlossherrn, der als Richter in einer Vogtei t\u00e4tig war, und selbst Hexenprozesse gef\u00fchrt hatte.\"",
                    "Die Expert:innen vermeiden in diesem Zusammenhang den feststehenden Begriff \"Hexenjagd\", weil das Ph\u00e4nomen in einem Drittel der F\u00e4lle auch M\u00e4nner betraf. Aber auch, weil der Begriff \"Jagd\" ein willentliches und gezieltes Vorgehen der Beh\u00f6rden suggeriert. \"Das Ph\u00e4nomen ist jedoch komplexer\", stellt der Archivar fest. \"Ohne die Beteiligung der Bev\u00f6lkerung, eines Verwandten oder von Nachbar:innen und ohne den Glauben an Teufel und Magie w\u00e4re es nicht so weit gekommen\".",
                    "\"Der Vorwurf der Hexerei war ein Ventil, um das Ungl\u00fcck der Zeit oder pers\u00f6nliche Missgeschicke zu erkl\u00e4ren\", sagt Dorthe. Ein ideales Mittel, um einen unliebsamen Nachbarn oder eine zu aufdringliche Schwiegermutter loszuwerden. \"Starb ein Kleinkind, wurde versucht, den Schuldigen oder die Schuldige zu finden, vor allem, wenn es sich um eine Hebamme oder einen Heiler handelte.\" Habe ein Bauer festgestellt, dass die Leistung seiner K\u00fche nachliess, habe er ebenfalls nach einem S\u00fcndenbock gesucht.",
                    "\"In Fribourg, wo die Milchwirtschaft wichtig war, wurden immer wieder Nachbarn beschuldigt, mit Zauberei den K\u00fchen die Milch abzuzapfen und sie in die Euter ihrer eigenen Tiere zu leiten\", erz\u00e4hlt Dorthe.",
                    "Mit Hexenprozessen verbindet die \u00d6ffentlichkeit oft Szenen von Folter und Tod auf dem Scheiterhaufen. Diese Vorstellung ist nicht falsch, die damalige Justiz war hart, aber nicht unbedingt blind.",
                    "Die Richter wandten zwar Folter an, aber nicht systematisch. Ausserdem war sie nur ein Werkzeug. \"Die Folter existierte, um die Arbeit der Justiz zu unterst\u00fctzen\", erinnert Lionel Dorthe. \"Wir m\u00fcssen jeden Anachronismus vermeiden, indem wir unsere Emotionen und \u00dcberzeugungen \u00fcber die der Vergangenheit stellen.\"",
                    "Man d\u00fcrfe die Richter nicht als Sadisten betrachten. Sie h\u00e4tten ihre Arbeit machen m\u00fcssen, und die damaligen Gesetzestexte h\u00e4tten ihnen erlaubt, Folter anzuwenden, \"um Zungen zu l\u00f6sen\".",
                    "Am Ende des Prozesses stand nicht unbedingt der Tod. In den meisten F\u00e4llen (40%) endeten die Prozesse mit der Verh\u00e4ngung der \u00e4usseren Verbannung \u2013 die verurteilte Person musste den Kanton verlassen \u2013 oder der inneren Verbannung \u2013 der oder die Verurteilte wurde auf seine Kirchgemeinde beschr\u00e4nkt und durfte diese nicht verlassen. In weniger als einem Drittel der F\u00e4lle (30%) wurde die Todesstrafe verh\u00e4ngt.",
                    "Bei Hexereiverbrechen erfolgte der Tod durch Verbrennen auf dem Scheiterhaufen. Bei der H\u00e4lfte der 80 in Fribourg verzeichneten Hinrichtungen wurde die Strafe \"gemildert\". Damit die verurteilte Person nicht durch die Flammen starb, wurde sie zun\u00e4chst erdrosselt. Manchmal wurde ihr auch ein S\u00e4ckchen mit Schiesspulver um den Hals gelegt, das explodierte und dem Tod durch Verbrennung zuvorkam.",
                    "Heute wird die Verfolgung wegen des Verbrechens der Hexerei als ein Ph\u00e4nomen dargestellt, das ausschliesslich Frauen betraf. Diese Darstellung wird jedoch von den Archiven nicht gest\u00fctzt. \"Die feministische Figur der Hexe entspricht in keiner Weise den historischen Quellen\", stellt Dorthe fest. Die Vorstellung, dass die Hexe eine unabh\u00e4ngige Frau gewesen sei, die den Hass des Patriarchats auf sich zog, sei falsch.",
                    "\"Diese Feminisierung des Ph\u00e4nomens hat ihren Ursprung in 'La sorci\u00e8re', einem Essay von Jules Michelet\", so Dorthe. Dieser franz\u00f6sische Historiker des 19. Jahrhunderts habe die Hexe in ein ideales oder idealisiertes Opfer verwandelt, in eine Figur, die gegen jede Autorit\u00e4t gek\u00e4mpft habe. \"Dieses Bild entsprach eher den sehr romantischen Sehns\u00fcchten des 19. Jahrhunderts als den historischen Tatsachen. Viele Feministinnen haben dieses Bild der emanzipierten oder emanzipatorischen Hexe ab den 1960er-Jahren wieder aufgegriffen.\"",
                    "Diese Vereinnahmung st\u00f6rt den Experten allerdings nicht. \"Als Wissenschaftler kann man das skandal\u00f6s finden, weil es nicht der Realit\u00e4t entspricht\", sagt Dorthe. Aber f\u00fcr die Wirksamkeit des Diskurses, den man heute f\u00fchren wolle, sei es zweifellos sinnvoller, ein Symbol zu verwenden als eine grosse Rede dagegen zu halten.",
                    "\"Wir leben in einer Gesellschaft, in der die Emotion \u00fcber die Vernunft siegt\", so der Experte.

                "en_content": "For six years, two members of the State Archive Fribourg, Lionel Dorthe and Rita Binz-Wohlhauser have examined the various registers and documents of 360 witch trials which were negotiated between 1493 and 1741 in the court of Fribourg City. The archive, which has been accessible online since last year, has now been published in two volumes by the Swiss Legal Association's Legal Source Foundation.\nInterest in these documents goes beyond the local framework. \"Normally, the investigations are limited to a very specific period or event,\" says Lionel Dorthe. To have documented all witch processes over such a long period is a premiere and can serve as a benchmark for other regions in the world.\nIn the public, witch processes are often associated with the Middle Ages and the Inquisition. This is only partly correct. \"It is the prejudice that these persecutions originate from the Middle Ages and that the Church has taken care of it, but in reality it is a phenomenon during the Ancien R\u00e9gimes,\" says Dorthe. From 16 to 18 Century would have taken place most of the processes in Europe and even in the USA. \"And they were almost exclusively led by secular courts.\"\n\"The phenomenon of persecution appears at the beginning of the 15th century \"The expert admits that the last of the Middle Ages is up. At that time, demonological treaties were written and one began to believe in the formation of a satanic cult which had been hostile to Christian society. \"On the basis it was actually the inquisition, which was mostly directed by Dominicans who had begun to persecute people for witchcraft.\"\nThe worldly authorities involved in the process from the beginning soon took over the rudder and were quick to accuse people of witchcraft.\nThe exaggeration of the phenomenon is different. If you take into account some missing registers and involve the processes in the Vogteien, you will come to about 1000 processes in 250 years for the entire canton of Fribourg. These were on average four per year, which is not a mass phenomenon. In the canton of Vaud, there were 3000 processes in the same period.\n\"Intensity was not the same in all regions of Europe,\" says Dorthe. Where power had not been secured, such as in the Waadtland under Bernian rule, the judges used their competencies in the fight against witchcraft. \"It is typical: the less power you had, the more you used it,\" says Dorthe. But in regions with more power, such as Fribourg or France, there was no competition for the prerogatives of justice and the witches' processes were not political weapons.\nThe Fribourg archives show that an indictment of witchcraft could hit almost everyone. \"Of course there were people who corresponded to the clich\u00e9: about an elderly woman who lived alone and worked as a healer,\" says Dorthe. But there was no typical profile. It also met men and even children. \"Even the social origin was diverse: So there was a man who worked as a judge in a vogtei and even had led witch processes.\"\nThe expert:in this context, the fixed term \"Hexenjagd\" is avoided because the phenomenon in one third of the cases also concerned men. But also because the term \"Jagd\" suggests a deliberate and targeted approach by the authorities. \"The phenomenon is more complex,\" the archivist notes. \"Without the participation of the population, relatives or neighbours, it would not have come so far without faith in devils and magic.\"\n\"The accusation of witchcraft was a valve to explain the misfortune of time or personal misfortunes,\" says Dorthe. An ideal way to get rid of an unloved neighbour or an intrusive mother-in-law. \"Start a toddler, was tried to find the guilty or the guilty, especially when it was a midwife or a healer.\" If a farmer found that the performance of his cows was left, he also searched for a scapegoat.\n\"In Fribourg, where the dairy industry was important, neighbours were repeatedly accused of digging the cows with magic and leading them to the udders of their own animals,\" says Dorthe.\nWith witch trials, the public often combines scenes of torture and death on the beater's pile. This idea is not wrong, the then judiciary was hard, but not necessarily blind.\nThe judges turned to torture, but not systematically. Besides, she was just a tool. \"The torture existed to support the work of justice,\" recalls Lionel Dorthe. \"We need to avoid any anachronism by putting our emotions and beliefs about the past.\"\nThe judges cannot be regarded as sadists. They should have done their work, and the legal texts at the time would have allowed them to use torture \"to solve tongues\".\nAt the end of the process was not necessarily death. In most cases (40%) the processes ended with the imposition of the external banishment \u2013 the convicted person had to leave the canton \u2013 or the internal banishment \u2013 the convicted person was limited to his parish and was not allowed to leave it. In less than one third of cases (30%) the death penalty was imposed.\nIn the case of witch-reiver breaks, death was caused by burning on the stake. In the case of half of the 80 executions recorded in Fribourg, the penalty was \"reduced\". So that the convicted person did not die by the flames, it was first strangled. Sometimes she was also put around her neck a small bag with skiess powder, which exploded and came before death by burning.\nToday, the persecution about the crime of witchcraft is presented as a phenomenon that exclusively concerned women. However, this representation is not supported by the archives. \"The feminist figure of the witch in no way corresponds to the historical sources,\" Dorthe notes. The idea that the witch was an independent woman who drew the hatred of the patriarchate was wrong.\n\"This feminization of the phenomenon originates in 'La sorci\u00e8re', an essay by Jules Michelet,\" says Dorthe. This French historian of the 19th The witch turned into an ideal or idealized victim, into a figure that fought against any authority. \"This picture was more like the very romantic longings of the 19th century. century as the historical facts. Many feminists have reopened this image of the emancipated or emancipatory witch from the 1960s.\"\nThis collection does not bother the expert. \"As a scientist you can find this scandalous because it does not correspond to reality,\" says Dorthe. But for the effectiveness of the discourse that we want to lead today, it is certainly more sensible to use a symbol than to keep a great speech against it.\n\"We live in a society where the emotion of reason prevails,\" says the expert. The reason for this is the social networks. \"It is therefore more effective to use an almost familiar figure like the witch, even if this figure is far from the historical reality.\"\nMore\n\nIn crises, many people tend to form anti-Semitic patterns \u2013 for centuries. Switzerland also has a longer history.\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                    "But her past has turned her into an archivist. Carefully, she takes a yellowing\u00a0sheet from one of the folders and places it on the table. The paper looks as though it was once folded up very small, and it is slightly torn at the edges. \"Motherly love?\" is typed at the top in narrow letters.",

                    "At the age of 15, Waser had already experienced 25 different homes, clinics and foster families. She was taken away from her mother when she was barely 18 months old. After that, she never spent more than a few months at a time with her.",
                    "The initiative for her removal came from the \u201cCharity for the Children of the Road\u201d (Hilfswerk f\u00fcr die Kinder der Landstrasse), which was founded in 1926 at the initiative of Dr\u00a0Alfred Siegfried of Pro Juventute. The aim of this \u201ccharitable\u201d programme was to take Yenish children from their families to \u201csettle them\u201d and combat the \u201cevil of vagrancy\u201d.",
                    "Vagrancy was perceived not only as a cause of child \u201cneglect\u201d, but also as a danger to society. Between 1926 and 1973, when this so-called \u201ccharity\u201d was dissolved, 586 Yenish children were torn from their families due to its interventions. Waser was one of them.",
                    "\"My mother was an easy victim for Pro Juventute,\" she says. Waser's mother had herself been taken away from her parents by the charity as a child. As a single mother of four children, she was overwhelmed, and she beat them. \u201cBut she was also literally hunted down and driven into a corner by Pro Juventute,\u201d Waser says. So in 1952, as soon as Waser was born, Siegfried did everything he could to gain custody of the girl. He wanted \u201cat all cost\u201d to prevent \u201ca new line of vagrants\u201d from emerging.",
                    "Waser was no better cared for in the homes to which he sent her than she was in her own, however. Punishments and beatings were routine. \u201cI will never forget lying on a table as a child, being held down by two sisters while the third beat me with a carpet beater.\"",
                    "For years, her mother tried to win back custody of her children. With no success. Waser was shunted from one home to the next. It was a fate she shared with many other \u201cchildren of the road\u201d. The result was upheaval and loneliness; even friendships were difficult. If two girls got along well together, they were separated as quickly as possible.",
                    "She did not find a loving home. The Erziehungsheim zum Guten Hirten (Good Shepherd Reformatory), where she spent several years, offered only \u201crepression, unkindness, loneliness,\u201d Waser says. \u201cI would never have belonged there.\u201d Every evening she prayed fervently \u201cdear God, give me a father and a mother.\u201d",

At the beginning of the 20th century, the Chur psychiatrist Josef J\u00f6rger was one of the first to compile lists of names and family trees of Yenish families to prove the genetic \u201cdegeneration\u201d of \u201cvagrant families\u201d. This so-called Sippenarchiv (clan archive) was later used for psychiatric reports. J\u00f6rger also supported a policy of settling travellers and destroying their way of life, because he hoped this would improve the gene pool of these families. This view was taken up by the \u201cChildren of the Road\u201d project.",
                    "In foster families, the children were to be raised to become \u201csettled citizens\u201d. However, most children grew up in care homes or institutions because too few foster families could be found. A childhood in care remained a stigma for those affected throughout their lives. \u201cI always glossed over my biography,\u201d Waser says. \"I was afraid that I wouldn't find work as a child from a care home.\u201d",
                    "Life for anyone who was classified as \u201cdifficult to educate\u201d by their guardian was particularly hard, because they had to go to a forced labour or work education institution, such as the Etablissements de Bellechasse in Sugiez, canton Fribourg. This prison, which rises above a bleak plain of endless vast fields, accommodated more than 100 \u201cchildren of the road\u201d who had never committed a criminal offence. This incarceration was justified as welfare. For the most part, the children in social care were housed separately from the juvenile offenders.",
                    "However, the agricultural work they had to do and the living conditions were almost the same as for the juvenile offenders. And society did not distinguish between the different reasons someone had been in Bellechasse. The general view was that \u201cno one ends up in prison without a valid reason\u201d.",
                    "As early as the 1940s, Yenish people turned to the media to complain about the charity\u2019s practices. But they were given no credence until the 1970s, when a wide-ranging debate on care homes broke out. In 1972, the first articles appeared in the ",
                    " newspaper. In 1973, 50 years ago, the Charity for the Children of the Road was dissolved under public pressure.",
                    "An era of political awareness and identity-building for the Yenish people followed. Numerous associations were founded. But above all it was a time of searching. Two or three generations of Yenish families had been torn apart and destroyed by the charity. People began searching for parents, siblings and lost children. Venanz Nobel, a Yenish man from Basel, remembers this time well.",
                    "\u201cBack then, people turned up at stands every day and asked if anyone knew their family,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery year, two or three people still contact me.\u201d",

In his father's files, they later found a handwritten note from Siegfried. He wrote that he was conducting an experiment by taking this boy out of the travelling milieu and giving him to a settled alcoholic. Significantly, the Nobel family were considered \u201ctravellers\u201d despite their permanent residence - because of their Yenish origins. That happened to many settled Yenish families at the time.",
                    "Sepp Nobel had a stroke of luck in this unfortunate situation. The \u201csettled alcoholic\u201d died, and his foster mother raised him lovingly. She also told him straight out that he was descended from \u201cgypsies.\u201d He wanted to know more. \u201cEvery year, my father travelled to Zurich to Pro Juventute and asked them to tell him who his parents and siblings were,\u201d Venanz Nobel says. But they refused to provide information, and at some point his father gave up the search.",
                    "It was only when Venanz Nobel became interested in his Yenish origins himself and began to investigate that he found what he was looking for. His grandfather had been dead for a long time; his grandmother had died recently. \u201cAt the funeral we met 50 new relatives, all at once,\u201d he recalls. \u00a0A short time later, Nobel bought a caravan and moved from one place to the next for 20 years. His father visited him, made his own friends, and at some point, also made peace with his Yenish identity, which he had previously seen mainly as a stigma.",
                    "Siegfried succeeded in preventing many marriages and determining the course his \u201cwards\u2019\u201d lives took. The care files about the \u201cchildren of the road\u201d were harshly defamatory. At the age of 14, Uschi Waser experienced first-hand what effects this could have. She filed a complaint against her stepfather, who had sexually abused and raped her for years. The court acquitted him, however, based on statements and file entries about Waser that portrayed her as untrustworthy. \u201cBasically, I didn't stand a chance from the start,\u201d she says.",
                    "During the trial, Waser tried to take her own life. \u201cI remember it as if it were today,\u201d she says. \u201cI wondered who would put a flower on my grave. And I reached the conclusion that no one would.\u201d Not her mother, who had sided with her husband in the trial. Nor the nuns who called her \u201cnaturally mendacious,\u201d nor the guardian who only showed up after she had slit her wrists. The suicide attempt was taken as an admission she was lying and Waser was sent to therapy - not as a victim, but because she was deemed \u201cpathological\u201d.",
                    "She still finds it hard to talk about that time. When she saw her files in 1989, at the age of 37, she finally understood just how unlucky she had been. \u201cI could never have imagined how cruel, how inhuman it was,\u201d she says.",
                    "The Pro Juventute guardianship files were a bone of contention between the people they concerned, the cantons and the government for years, until they were finally handed over to the Federal Archives in 1986. The victims could see the files for the first time. For many, it was a difficult part of their search for family and identity. Nobel, for example, talks about his father's feelings.\u00a0\u201cEven if you know the difference between facts and files, four federal files full of derogatory statements about you and your family don\u2019t leave anyone indifferent,\u201d he shares.",

                "en_content": "A pile of files sits on the dining table in Uschi Waser\u2019s flat in Holderbank in canton Aargau. They are just a few of the many that Waser has accumulated over the course of her life. Waser is a member of the Yenish community, a nomadic people present in western Europe.\nBut her past has turned her into an archivist. Carefully, she takes a yellowing\u00a0sheet from one of the folders and places it on the table. The paper looks as though it was once folded up very small, and it is slightly torn at the edges. \"Motherly love?\" is typed at the top in narrow letters.\n\u201cI wrote this poem when I was fifteen,\u201d says Waser, who is now 71. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine. You can't get much lonelier than that.\u201d\nAt the age of 15, Waser had already experienced 25 different homes, clinics and foster families. She was taken away from her mother when she was barely 18 months old. After that, she never spent more than a few months at a time with her.\nThe initiative for her removal came from the \u201cCharity for the Children of the Road\u201d (Hilfswerk f\u00fcr die Kinder der Landstrasse), which was founded in 1926 at the initiative of Dr\u00a0Alfred Siegfried of Pro Juventute. The aim of this \u201ccharitable\u201d programme was to take Yenish children from their families to \u201csettle them\u201d and combat the \u201cevil of vagrancy\u201d.\nVagrancy was perceived not only as a cause of child \u201cneglect\u201d, but also as a danger to society. Between 1926 and 1973, when this so-called \u201ccharity\u201d was dissolved, 586 Yenish children were torn from their families due to its interventions. Waser was one of them.\n\"My mother was an easy victim for Pro Juventute,\" she says. Waser's mother had herself been taken away from her parents by the charity as a child. As a single mother of four children, she was overwhelmed, and she beat them. \u201cBut she was also literally hunted down and driven into a corner by Pro Juventute,\u201d Waser says. So in 1952, as soon as Waser was born, Siegfried did everything he could to gain custody of the girl. He wanted \u201cat all cost\u201d to prevent \u201ca new line of vagrants\u201d from emerging.\nWaser was no better cared for in the homes to which he sent her than she was in her own, however. Punishments and beatings were routine. \u201cI will never forget lying on a table as a child, being held down by two sisters while the third beat me with a carpet beater.\"\nFor years, her mother tried to win back custody of her children. With no success. Waser was shunted from one home to the next. It was a fate she shared with many other \u201cchildren of the road\u201d. The result was upheaval and loneliness; even friendships were difficult. If two girls got along well together, they were separated as quickly as possible.\nShe did not find a loving home. The Erziehungsheim zum Guten Hirten (Good Shepherd Reformatory), where she spent several years, offered only \u201crepression, unkindness, loneliness,\u201d Waser says. \u201cI would never have belonged there.\u201d Every evening she prayed fervently \u201cdear God, give me a father and a mother.\u201d\n\u201cI prayed so much, enough for a lifetime,\u201d she says.\nThe \u201ccharity\u201d drew on the eugenic and racist concepts of \u201cvagrant research\u201d. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Chur psychiatrist Josef J\u00f6rger was one of the first to compile lists of names and family trees of Yenish families to prove the genetic \u201cdegeneration\u201d of \u201cvagrant families\u201d. This so-called Sippenarchiv (clan archive) was later used for psychiatric reports. J\u00f6rger also supported a policy of settling travellers and destroying their way of life, because he hoped this would improve the gene pool of these families. This view was taken up by the \u201cChildren of the Road\u201d project.\nIn foster families, the children were to be raised to become \u201csettled citizens\u201d. However, most children grew up in care homes or institutions because too few foster families could be found. A childhood in care remained a stigma for those affected throughout their lives. \u201cI always glossed over my biography,\u201d Waser says. \"I was afraid that I wouldn't find work as a child from a care home.\u201d\nLife for anyone who was classified as \u201cdifficult to educate\u201d by their guardian was particularly hard, because they had to go to a forced labour or work education institution, such as the Etablissements de Bellechasse in Sugiez, canton Fribourg. This prison, which rises above a bleak plain of endless vast fields, accommodated more than 100 \u201cchildren of the road\u201d who had never committed a criminal offence. This incarceration was justified as welfare. For the most part, the children in social care were housed separately from the juvenile offenders.\nHowever, the agricultural work they had to do and the living conditions were almost the same as for the juvenile offenders. And society did not distinguish between the different reasons someone had been in Bellechasse. The general view was that \u201cno one ends up in prison without a valid reason\u201d.\nAs early as the 1940s, Yenish people turned to the media to complain about the charity\u2019s practices. But they were given no credence until the 1970s, when a wide-ranging debate on care homes broke out. In 1972, the first articles appeared in the \n newspaper. In 1973, 50 years ago, the Charity for the Children of the Road was dissolved under public pressure.\nAn era of political awareness and identity-building for the Yenish people followed. Numerous associations were founded. But above all it was a time of searching. Two or three generations of Yenish families had been torn apart and destroyed by the charity. People began searching for parents, siblings and lost children. Venanz Nobel, a Yenish man from Basel, remembers this time well.\n\u201cBack then, people turned up at stands every day and asked if anyone knew their family,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery year, two or three people still contact me.\u201d\nHis father, Sepp Nobel, was taken away from his parents as a child and had grown up with a foster family. In his father's files, they later found a handwritten note from Siegfried. He wrote that he was conducting an experiment by taking this boy out of the travelling milieu and giving him to a settled alcoholic. Significantly, the Nobel family were considered \u201ctravellers\u201d despite their permanent residence - because of their Yenish origins. That happened to many settled Yenish families at the time.\nSepp Nobel had a stroke of luck in this unfortunate situation. The \u201csettled alcoholic\u201d died, and his foster mother raised him lovingly. She also told him straight out that he was descended from \u201cgypsies.\u201d He wanted to know more. \u201cEvery year, my father travelled to Zurich to Pro Juventute and asked them to tell him who his parents and siblings were,\u201d Venanz Nobel says. But they refused to provide information, and at some point his father gave up the search.\nIt was only when Venanz Nobel became interested in his Yenish origins himself and began to investigate that he found what he was looking for. His grandfather had been dead for a long time; his grandmother had died recently. \u201cAt the funeral we met 50 new relatives, all at once,\u201d he recalls. \u00a0A short time later, Nobel bought a caravan and moved from one place to the next for 20 years. His father visited him, made his own friends, and at some point, also made peace with his Yenish identity, which he had previously seen mainly as a stigma.\nSiegfried succeeded in preventing many marriages and determining the course his \u201cwards\u2019\u201d lives took. The care files about the \u201cchildren of the road\u201d were harshly defamatory. At the age of 14, Uschi Waser experienced first-hand what effects this could have. She filed a complaint against her stepfather, who had sexually abused and raped her for years. The court acquitted him, however, based on statements and file entries about Waser that portrayed her as untrustworthy. \u201cBasically, I didn't stand a chance from the start,\u201d she says.\nDuring the trial, Waser tried to take her own life. \u201cI remember it as if it were today,\u201d she says. \u201cI wondered who would put a flower on my grave. And I reached the conclusion that no one would.\u201d Not her mother, who had sided with her husband in the trial. Nor the nuns who called her \u201cnaturally mendacious,\u201d nor the guardian who only showed up after she had slit her wrists. The suicide attempt was taken as an admission she was lying and Waser was sent to therapy - not as a victim, but because she was deemed \u201cpathological\u201d.\nShe still finds it hard to talk about that time. When she saw her files in 1989, at the age of 37, she finally understood just how unlucky she had been. \u201cI could never have imagined how cruel, how inhuman it was,\u201d she says.\nThe Pro Juventute guardianship files were a bone of contention between the people they concerned, the cantons and the government for years, until they were finally handed over to the Federal Archives in 1986. The victims could see the files for the first time. For many, it was a difficult part of their search for family and identity. Nobel, for example, talks about his father's feelings.\u00a0\u201cEven if you know the difference between facts and files, four federal files full of derogatory statements about you and your family don\u2019t leave anyone indifferent,\u201d he shares.\nWithout these files, Waser would be a different person today. But she would also never have gone public with her story. \u201cI had to, otherwise I would have suffocated on it, killed myself or ended up an alcoholic,\u201d she says. Now she is one of the few people affected who has told her story. Many others can't, or don't want to anymore.\nAs president of the Naschet Jenische Foundation (the name means \u201cRise Up, Yenish people!\u201d), Waser is strongly committed to publicly confronting the past, has worked on a wide variety of projects, and has given countless interviews. But even she has never spoken to her daughters in detail about her past. Instead, she has developed her own strategies to come to terms with it. She has gained the upper hand over the files that for so long determined her life and controlled every step she takes. And she always keeps a door open for herself. \u201cI always need an escape route, a \u2018via d'uscita,\u2019\u201d she says. Her \u201cvia d'uscita\u201d can mean a car of her own so that she can drive away at any time, or even just having enough cash on her to stay in a hotel.\nWhat remains is her mistrust of authorities and the fear of having to go back into care. \u201cI signed up for Exit,\u00a0the assisted suicide organisation,\" Waser says. \u201cNow I just have to hope I don\u2019t miss the right moment to jump.\u201d\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

The importance of these elections, and the ones to come, resonates with the families of immigrants \u2013 men and women \u2013 wherever they are. For families, the political orientations of Switzerland, the features of which are decided in the federal assembly, can shape the future or even determine the destinies of thousands of people, especially concerning immigration and international cooperation.

Only \n are eligible to vote at the federal level.\nSome might argue: why would a foreigner like me be interested in Swiss federal elections? Apart from the obvious answer that I am a journalist who works in Switzerland, the answer to this question goes beyond the country\u2019s borders. The importance of these elections, and the ones to come, resonates with the families of immigrants \u2013 men and women \u2013 wherever they are. For families, the political orientations of Switzerland, the features of which are decided in the federal assembly, can shape the future or even determine the destinies of thousands of people, especially concerning immigration and international cooperation. This is the core of Switzerland\u2019s global importance. It is not only about internal politics but about the repercussions of those policies on people\u2019s lives outside.\nThough I\u2019m currently not eligible to cast my vote, I remain vigilant and closely observe the upcoming elections in October 2023. Standing outside the democratic arena, I do what those who are side-lined often do: I nourish the dream that I will one day be allowed to join this democratic dance.\nIn Switzerland, parties have a completely different role than what is known in China.\nIn the preamble to the Chinese constitution, the \u201cCommunist Party of the People\u2019s Republic of China (CCP)\u201d is more prominent than \u201cGod the Almighty\u201d is in the preamble of the Swiss constitution. While article 1 of the Swiss constitution lists all 26 cantons that form the Swiss confederation, article 1 of the Chinese constitution makes clear that the socialist system is the fundamental system of the People\u2019s Republic of China and that the leadership by the Communist Party defines Chinese socialism.\nThe office of the General Secretary of the CCP has absolute power in China while the political power of the general secretaries and presidents of Swiss parties depends on how persuasive they are in the elections. The legal status of political parties in Switzerland is rather weak. It was only in 1999 that a small article (Art. 137) on the status of the political parties was added to the constitution, which says: \u201cThe political parties shall contribute to forming the opinion and the will of the people.\u201d However, we never talk about one party\u2019s relationship with the state in Switzerland because there are so many different parties. Eleven parties are represented in parliament, four of which are also represented in the government.\nThe party landscape in Switzerland is constantly changing. Parties come and go, some merge, others change their name, and some remain the same. All parties must repeatedly stand their ground when it comes to political concepts and the fight for their voters\u2019 share. They have to convince their voters by offering good solutions to the issues that concern the population. At the end, the voters decide, and sometimes they have no mercy when they are not happy with a party\u2019s performance.\nThe United States and Switzerland have a lot in common. They are both proud of their democracies and the enshrined right to vote. Increasingly, they have something else in common \u2013 growing polarisation.\n\u201cNo forum seems too small or too sleepy to be polarised\u201d in the US. This is a direct quote from The \n a couple years ago. Over the last decade, an \u201cus vs. them\u201d mentality has cast a dark cloud over the US, pervading nearly every area of life \u2013 from the halls of the Capitol Building to the \n. Such extremes have for a long time seemed far away from Switzerland\u2019s multi-party and consensus-based system: Switzerland has six main parties and a dozen smaller ones jockeying for seats in parliament.\nBut there are signs people in Switzerland are also moving farther into their different poles. One recent \n revealed people fear the population is breaking up into ever smaller groups that are increasingly irreconcilable towards one another. As one Swiss friend told me: \u201cEverything seems very black and white these days\u201d.\nSome say the Covid-19 pandemic was a \n in Switzerland. This drew new and sharper dividing lines between groups of people.\nThis isn\u2019t just about policies or positions on issues \u2013 such diverse views are normal in a democratic society. Today\u2019s polarisation in both countries is emotional and tied to a growing intolerance towards people with different points of view. While some of the issues that divide people may be different \u2013 for example, abortion is a much more divisive issue in the US than in Switzerland \u2013 in both places, I find people are increasingly quick to judge someone\u2019s character based on whether they are for or against an issue.\nSwitzerland hasn\u2019t reached the extremes seen in the US, but nevertheless growing polarisation in a country with multiple parties and high \n in \n is unsettling.\nPolarisation isn\u2019t good for countries or democracies. It means people stop talking to each other. They stay in their echo chamber, stifling debate and preventing new ideas from coming to the fore.\nIt can also make people disillusioned with politics altogether. When voters see politicians more focused on drawing dividing lines than on finding solutions, they are likely to look for answers elsewhere retreating to their \u201ccamps\u201d and perpetuating the cycle.\nAs the federal elections approach, how Switzerland deals with polarising politics will send a message to the US and democracies everywhere.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nElection campaigns in Switzerland are not as boring as people abroad generally believe, says Zo\u00e9 Kergomard. \nArticles in this story\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

The platform finds answer to questions such as, how\u00a0often did each party appear in the press? Which issue dominated? This year, 4,106 articles analysed during eight weeks threw up a range of issues: while \u201chealth insurance premiums and health\u201d might have been the most common, other themes like banks, traffic, energy, migration, and climate were all present, write the researchers Anja Heidelberger and Marc B\u00fchlmann.",

This year however, media coverage of the campaign was not based around \u201ca single predominant issue\u201d, the analysis says.",

Marc B\u00fchlmann, one of the co-authors of the study and the director of Ann\u00e9e Politique Suisse, tells SWI swissinfo.ch that \u201cin Switzerland, with its low participation rate, the central question of a campaign is which party manages to mobilise its pre-existing base. Four years ago, when the Greens were seen by the climate movement as a solution, the party\u2019s base was more strongly mobilised.\u201d",
                    "This time the party was less successful in turning the \u2013 still present \u2013 climate issue to its benefit. When media reports on climate are connected with activist who glue themselves to streets to block traffic \u2013 this doesn\u2019t help the Green Party.",

                "en_content": "Long before final results were confirmed, the websites of newspapers from the Tamedia group had already announced a \u201chistoric\u201d election result. Projections showed the right-wing Swiss People\u2019s Party would emerge as clear winners, while, just as clearly, the left-wing Greens would lose.\nWhile Swiss media have largely focused on the bad result for the Green Party, international media have been more interested in the victory of the People\u2019s Party.\nThis result will once again make the People\u2019s Party the strongest political group in Switzerland, the \u201cpopulist right\u201d has won using issues like \u201cthe fight against mass immigration\u201d, the conservative French newspaper \nwrote. \nled with the headline that \u201cthe populist right is growing\u201d in Switzerland. For \n, the \u201canti-immigration\u201d group has cemented its position as the strongest Swiss party.\nBut the current portrayal of the election as so historic is in stark contrast to the fact that the run-up to the vote was so muted: the end period of campaigning this year was hardly noticeable in the media.\nSwiss elections are not renowned for ushering in huge changes \u2013 you would have to look hard to find drama. And since the start of the Israeli-Palestinian war, public interest has decisively shifted towards the global crises.\u00a0Reporting on the 2023 elections may also have been stunted due to the lack of any one overarching campaign theme \u2013 which wasn\u2019t the case four years ago with environmental topics taking centre stage with the\u00a0\u201cGreen Wave\u201d.\nThe \u201cAnn\u00e9e Politique Suisse\u201d platform analyses print media coverage of Swiss elections and votes according to scientific criteria. The platform finds answer to questions such as, how\u00a0often did each party appear in the press? Which issue dominated? This year, 4,106 articles analysed during eight weeks threw up a range of issues: while \u201chealth insurance premiums and health\u201d might have been the most common, other themes like banks, traffic, energy, migration, and climate were all present, write the researchers Anja Heidelberger and Marc B\u00fchlmann.\nThis marks a change from the 2019 elections, which have gone down in memory as \u201cclimate\u201d and \u201cwomen's\u201d votes; in 2015, a period of high asylum applications meant reports about migration dominated. This year however, media coverage of the campaign was not based around \u201ca single predominant issue\u201d, the analysis says.\nBecause voter participation in Switzerland is low by international comparison, mobilising supporters is key to deciding the outcome. Marc B\u00fchlmann, one of the co-authors of the study and the director of Ann\u00e9e Politique Suisse, tells SWI swissinfo.ch that \u201cin Switzerland, with its low participation rate, the central question of a campaign is which party manages to mobilise its pre-existing base. Four years ago, when the Greens were seen by the climate movement as a solution, the party\u2019s base was more strongly mobilised.\u201d\nThis time the party was less successful in turning the \u2013 still present \u2013 climate issue to its benefit. When media reports on climate are connected with activist who glue themselves to streets to block traffic \u2013 this doesn\u2019t help the Green Party.\nThe Ann\u00e9e Politique Suisse researchers also analyse how often parties appear in the media. On this score, the right-wing People\u2019s Party \u2013 the strongest in the country \u2013 is most often mentioned, followed by the left-wing Social Democrats, the centre-right Radical-Liberals, and the centrist Centre Party.\nThe frequency of media coverage corresponds strikingly similarly to the share of votes won by the parties in the 2019 elections. However, the four main parties \u2013 with a seat in government \u2013 parties are over-represented in proportion to smaller parties; the most under-represented are the small opposition groups the Protestant Party, the Federal Democratic Union, the Geneva Citizens\u2019 Movement, and the Lega dei Ticinesi. \u201cTheir [combined] voter share of 10.1% corresponds to a media coverage share of 3.4%,\u201d the analysis states.\nB\u00fchlmann says it\u2019s remarkable that the media mentions correspond so well to the 2019 election results. \u201cIt\u2019s still surprising how good the print media manages to portray the prevailing situation with regard to electoral strength,\u201d he says.\nPolitical parties also campaign on social media, but B\u00fchlmann says it is more negligible. \u201cA large amount of voters are middle-aged people \u2013 they do not use social media as a source of information,\u201d he says.

The return of inflation and the announcement of a substantial rise in health insurance premiums just one month before the federal elections put social issues back at the heart of the stakes. The Social Democrats were thus able to win back a few votes from the Greens in the left-wing camp.",

                    "The Christian Democratic Party, of which the Centre\u00a0is an offshoot, took advantage of this four years ago, when the Greens narrowly overtook it in terms of votes. In 2021, the Christian Democratic Party merged with the Conservative Democratic Party under the new name of the Centre and has put its house in order.",
                    "One thing is certain: in the current constellation, the Centre will be even more enterprising and establish itself as the undisputed political force at the centre of the political spectrum. Under the leadership of party president Gerhard Pfister, it has shed its proverbial low profile. In the House of Representatives, it remains an important coalition partner for the Radical-Liberals and the People's Party, which between them don't have a majority. In the Senate, it should remain the most\u00a0important force.",
                    "Switzerland, a model democracy, is tired of politics. This is how we might analyse the turnout at these elections. At 46.6%, voter turnout is admittedly slightly higher than in 2019 (45%). But as has always been the case in recent decades, more than half the electorate failed to turn out at the polls.

                "en_content": "More\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland has voted: here are the results of which parties won and lost in the two houses of parliament. \nEnvironmental politics has lost its appeal, in Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe. The defeat of the Green Party\u00a0and the Liberal Green Party echoes the difficulties experienced by green parties within the European Union. According to polls, they are also likely to suffer a setback in the European elections in June 2024.\nDuring the 2019 election campaign, green themes had dominated public debate and provoked great mobilisation on the left of the political spectrum, notably with the organisation of climate strikes. This wasn\u2019t the case this year.\nThe trend seems paradoxical at a time when extreme weather events are multiplying and climate disruption remains one of Switzerland\u2019s main concerns. However, the fact that it's hot in October is not the primary concern of the population, a growing number of whom are struggling to make ends meet. And the urgency of climate change may also be creating a sense of powerlessness among the electorate.\nIn the end, environmental groups failed to make climate change \u201csexy\u201d. On the contrary, they have suffered from the hard-hitting actions of radical climate activists, who provoked confusion and even anger among a large part of the population.\nThe images of the Italian island of Lampedusa, confronted with a huge influx of migrants from North Africa, went around the world and brought asylum policy back to the forefront during this election year. This has been a boon for the right-wing Swiss People\u2019s Party, which has focused its campaign on its favourite theme, the fight against immigration.\nWith the rise in asylum applications (12,188 between the beginning of January and the end of June, or +43% compared to 2022), in addition to the presence of 65,000 refugees from Ukraine, the Swiss People\u2019s Party was able to capitalise on the growing concerns of part of the population.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nFinal results for the 2023 Swiss federal elections show that the Swiss parliament will be more right-wing and less green. \nBrandishing the spectre of a Switzerland with ten million inhabitants on its campaign posters, the People\u2019s Party didn\u2019t mince its words, drawing \n from the Federal Commission against Racism.

                    "On the other hand, in contrast to the national picture, the Swiss People\u2019s Party cannot be said to have triumphed at the ballot box among Swiss expatriates.",

                    "As is often the case, voter turnout among the Swiss Abroad remained low, at 18.7% (compared with 46.6% nationally), and was down in virtually all cantons with the exception of Basel City and St Gallen. At national level, however, it rose slightly compared with 2019, from 45.1% to 46.6%.",
                    "Forty-three Swiss nationals from abroad stood for election in these federal elections. Unsurprisingly, none of these candidates made the grade. Nevertheless, the results of two members of the diaspora stood out.",

                "en_content": "One of the main conclusions to be drawn from Sunday\u2019s federal elections is that the green wave that characterised the 2019 legislative elections is a thing of the past. At national level, the two green parties suffered a real slap in the face.\nAt 9.4%, the Greens\u2019 share of the vote fell by 3.8 percentage points and the party lost five seats. Only the other ecologist party, the Liberal Greens, had a worse result in terms of mandates (losing six seats and recording a 0.6 percentage point drop in electoral share to 7.2%).\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland has voted: here are the results of which parties won and lost in the two houses of parliament. \nSwiss living abroad also voted significantly less for the Greens this year. In all 12 cantons that provide separate statistics on the diaspora vote, the Green Party lost 5.4 percentage points in electoral share, dropping from first place in 2019 (with 23.8% of the vote) to third place this year (with 18.4%).\nThis is despite the fact that the Swiss Abroad traditionally vote more in favour of the climate than their compatriots in Switzerland, as has been the case in recent popular votes on this issue. According to Martina Mousson, a political scientist at gfs.bern, the Green Party\u2019s decline is linked to the current context, both abroad and in Switzerland.\nThe situation now is fundamentally different from the situation four years ago, she said. \u201cAlthough the climate remains one of the main concerns of the Swiss, it was clearly not a relevant issue for the elections and was overshadowed by other global themes\u201d, such as the war in Ukraine, the economic situation or inflation, Mousson said. \u201cSwitzerland is not the only country concerned.\u201d\nAt national level, the left-wing Social Democratic Party recorded the second-biggest increase behind the People\u2019s Party (1.2 percentage points to 18% of the vote). Abroad, it made the biggest gains (2.8 percentage points, from 17.6% to 20.4% of the vote).\nThe main change in the vote of Swiss living abroad in 2023 therefore seems to be a transfer to the Social Democrats of the votes that went to the Greens in 2019.\nDoes this mean the Greens have lost the confidence of the expatriate population? \u201cI don\u2019t think the Greens have done anything wrong,\u201d Mousson said. \u201cIn general, right-wing parties have a better chance of doing well in uncertain global situations.\u201d She believes the ecologists have probably fallen victim to the global economic situation this year, whereas they benefited from it four years ago.\nOn the other hand, in contrast to the national picture, the Swiss People\u2019s Party cannot be said to have triumphed at the ballot box among Swiss expatriates.\nThe right-wing party, the country\u2019s leading political force, which also saw the strongest growth this year (nine new seats and 28.6% of the vote, up three percentage points), also saw an increase beyond Switzerland\u2019s borders, albeit more moderate: from 18% to 18.5% of the diaspora vote.\nThe People\u2019s Party remains the second political force among the Swiss Abroad but with scores that are still significantly lower than those achieved at national level.\nBut the Swiss electorate abroad is traditionally more liberal and left-leaning than the rest of the country. \u201cThis is nothing new, which is why I\u2019m not surprised that the People\u2019s Party has not made greater inroads abroad,\u201d Mousson said.\nOverall, the way\u00a0the diaspora voted confirms the tendency of this electorate to lean more to the left and more green than the domestic population.

The conservative right has made this one of its main campaign themes for the federal elections on\u00a0October 22. \u00a0\nWith the issue of immigration becoming more and more controversial, other solutions are being put forward to try to overcome the shortage. The business community wants to make the most of the potential of the resident\u00a0workforce. First and foremost, this applies to women, nearly six out of ten of whom work part-time - a rate that is almost unheard of in Europe. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nThere are also other pools of labour within the population that can be tapped: young people, the elderly, refugees and social welfare\u00a0recipients. The Conference of Social Welfare Institutions (CSIAS) and the Swiss Federation for Continuing Education (FSEA) have recently launched a training offensive for people on social welfare, whereas the focus until now has been on professional reintegration.\n\"Experience shows that improving skills makes integration into the labour market more sustainable. This is a paradigm shift in the field\", explains FSEA President Matthias Aebischer.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nAmid labour shortages, Swiss social services want to promote people\u2019s reintegration into the job market through further education. \nThe scarcity of labour is also a boon for all those people already in employment. They now hold the upper hand in\u00a0wage negotiations. With the balance of power shifting in favour of the employees and their representatives, demands from unions may increase in\u00a0the future. \u00a0\nThis new situation is also leading to a growing desire for professional mobility, particularly among the younger generation. Although the scale of this trend has not yet reached the \"Great Resignation\" phenomenon observed in the United States or the United Kingdom, companies are nevertheless forced to make 180-degree organisational and cultural shifts in order to attract and retain young talent. \u00a0 \u00a0\nMore\nDebate\nAre you also affected in your company or your field of work?

While the finances of the old-age insurance system are particularly affected by the rise in life expectancy, the finances of the occupational pension provision are also affected by market turbulence: a poor economic climate can quickly lead to a decline in the investment performance of pension funds.",

                "en_content": "After decades of hard-fought battles, the Swiss people have finally voted to raise the retirement age for women from 64 to 65, on a par with men. They were convinced by the urgency of taking measures to maintain the level of old-age pensions. However, the \u201cyes\u201d vote was only 50.5%, and the ballot revealed two major divisions within the country: between men and women, and between the German-speaking cantons and the rest.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nA slim majority of voters has endorsed a proposed reform of the basic old-age pension scheme in a ballot billed as key in Swiss politics. \nLike many other countries, Switzerland\u2019s pension system is being weakened by rising life expectancy: the number of people in work is no longer high enough compared with the number of pensioners. The authorities predict that the pension insurance system will no longer balance its books from 2032 onwards, despite the increase in the retirement age for women.\nHowever, the Swiss system is characterised by its diversity because it is based on three \u201cpillars\u201d: old-age and survivors\u2019 insurance (OASI), occupational pension provision (second pillar) and individual pension provision (third pillar). The OASI is intended to guarantee a minimum standard of living and is compulsory for everyone, the occupational pension provision is intended to guarantee the previous standard of living and is compulsory for everyone who is employed, while the third pillar is an optional and tax-efficient private savings scheme.\n\n\n\n\nSwiss social security is split into three \u2018pillars\u2019, to help retired people continue to finance their way of life after retirement. \nHowever, the three-pillar system does not live up to its promise, as the pensions paid by the OASI are not sufficient to live on and many pensioners have to rely on supplementary state benefits. In addition, women and low-income earners are under-represented in the occupational pension provision and therefore generally receive a lower pension. While the finances of the old-age insurance system are particularly affected by the rise in life expectancy, the finances of the occupational pension provision are also affected by market turbulence: a poor economic climate can quickly lead to a decline in the investment performance of pension funds.\nIn order to reduce inequalities in retirement and to cope with the demographic changes in society, the Swiss authorities have initiated several reforms, as have many other countries. But Switzerland\u2019s direct democracy and the complexity of the system are slowing down the process. A revision of the OASI, which included an increase in the retirement age for women, was rejected by voters in 2004. A new project modifying the functioning of both the first and second pillars, still with the aim of pushing back women\u2019s retirement, was again swept aside at the ballot box in 2017.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe revision of the old-age pension system accepted by the people on Sunday was only the first step. \nIt was not until September 2022 that the umpteenth revision of the OASI was finally accepted in a popular vote, with an increase in value-added tax (VAT) and the much talked-about increase in the retirement age for women from 64 to 65. A small revolution in Switzerland, while most industrialised countries have long since delayed retirement and abolished age differences between the sexes.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nLike in many industrialised countries, Switzerland is trying to align the age of retirement between men and women. \nThe increase in the retirement age for women in Switzerland is only the first step: there is still a long way to go before the entire system becomes sustainable. The revision of the OASI adopted by voters does not solve the financial problems of the old-age insurance system in the long term, nor does it reduce inequalities. A new reform of the first pillar is inevitable.\nA revision of the second pillar is underway, but it is generating a lot of criticism and is deeply dividing the parties on the left and right. Pensions will continue to be the subject of numerous debates and popular votes in the coming years.\nArticles in this story\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

                "en_content": "Switzerland\u2019s history prior to becoming a democratic state in 1848 is hardly known beyond its borders. This is partially because it largely developed along different lines and routes than its neighbours.\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland as we know it today developed slowly over the centuries, gradually coming together from a patchwork of territories. \nThe\u00a0history can be divided into two\u00a0major\u00a0periods: before\u00a0and after\u00a01848, the year when\u00a0the loose\u00a0confederacy\u00a0of cantons or\u00a0\u201csmall states\u201d\u00a0became\u00a0a federal state. But when exactly did this\u00a0confederation begin to take shape? The period prior to the foundation of the federal state\u00a0can\u00a0be roughly\u00a0divided\u00a0into five developmental\u00a0eras.\u00a0\nFor a long time,\u00a0the year\u00a01307\u00a0\u2013\u00a0when the Austrian bailiffs\u00a0were expelled from Switzerland\u00a0\u2013\u00a0was considered\u00a0the\u00a0time\u00a0it all began. This is why this\u00a0date can still be seen\u00a0on the base of the Wilhelm Tell\u00a0monument\u00a0in Altdorf.\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, at the end of the 19th\u00a0century, the Swiss\u00a0made a conscious decision\u00a0to refer to the year 1291 as the start of the democratic process. The political assassin Tell was\u00a0just not suitable\u00a0as a symbol\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0new state. A\u00a0treaty of alliance\u00a0such as\u00a0the\u00a0Federal Charter,\u00a0which\u00a0was signed by\u00a0aristocratic representatives of the three\u00a0founding\u00a0cantons\u00a0in central Switzerland at the beginning of August 1291,\u00a0was a much better\u00a0option.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn this document, the\u00a0founding\u00a0cantons promised to support each other militarily and economically.\u00a0Today, the\u00a0significance of this date\u00a0is disputed among Swiss historians. Even though it has symbolic importance, nothing special actually happened. Countless federal letters\u00a0were signed before and after this date.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nIn Switzerland, as in France, \u201cMarignano 1515\u201d is one of the most recognised historic dates. \nBeyond Swiss borders, it is widely believed that Swiss\u00a0statehood was\u00a0a result of military resistance to\u00a0the\u00a0rise of\u00a0the Habsburg\u00a0dynasty.\u00a0However, this\u00a0theory\u00a0has nothing\u00a0to do with reality. In the early Middle Ages, a certain territorial or administrative unit could only\u00a0survive politically and economically\u00a0if it was protected by supreme authorities, in this case the\u00a0Holy\u00a0Roman Empire.\u00a0But\u00a0being an\u00a0inhospitable mountainous European region, Switzerland\u00a0could not\u00a0hope for\u00a0patronage or military support from the Empire as it had nothing to offer in return.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe\u00a0future cantons had\u00a0no other choice than\u00a0to join forces and defend and support each other\u00a0for\u00a0the lack of external protection from the Empire.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland doesn\u2019t take sides in a war. Thanks to its neutrality, it has been able to stay out of conflicts for a long time. \nThe\u00a0regions in central Switzerland as well as\u00a0the\u00a0canton\u00a0of\u00a0Bern, which historians often described as\u00a0\u201cSwiss Prussia\u201d, were at the core of the crystallisation of the confederation.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs the cantons\u00a0formed a defensive\u00a0as well as an economic alliance, Switzerland expanded beyond German-speaking Europe.\u00a0It conquered regions on the northern French-speaking shore of Lake Geneva\u00a0and\u00a0clashed with\u00a0the Grand Duchy of Burgundy.\u00a0Under the leadership of Charles the Bold of Burgundy, it\u00a0similarly strived to become one of Europe\u2019s great powers\u00a0at that\u00a0time.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nFrom time to time there is talk in Switzerland about creating larger cantons. Yet such ideas never seem to gain traction. \nThe\u00a0Burgundian Wars\u00a0(1474 \u2013 1477)\u00a0marked\u00a0the most important period in Swiss history. After\u00a0Switzerland\u2019s\u00a0victory, new regions\u00a0were conquered and\u00a0significant funds\u00a0that\u00a0formed the base\u00a0of prosperity\u00a0and power for Bern as well as the other regions of the Old Swiss Confederacy\u00a0were gained.\u00a0\u00a0\nAfter 1515, the\u00a0Reformation\u00a0triggered\u00a0permanent religious conflicts\u00a0in Switzerland,\u00a0which\u00a0culminated\u00a0in the\u00a0two\u00a0Wars\u00a0of Kappel (1529 and 1531)\u00a0as well as the\u00a0two\u00a0Wars\u00a0of\u00a0Villmergen\u00a0(1656 and 1712).\u00a0In between\u00a0these two conflicts,\u00a0a fifth war was waged. The\u00a0Swiss Peasant War of 1653\u00a0was\u00a0triggered by\u00a0the end of the Thirty Years\u2019 War\u00a0when Swiss\u00a0farmers,\u00a0who\u00a0were providing warring Germany with cereals,\u00a0suddenly\u00a0went\u00a0bankrupt.\u00a0\u00a0\nDuring these\u00a0terrible\u00a0conflicts,\u00a0Switzerland\u00a0turned away from the outside world. It\u00a0focussed on solving\u00a0its domestic conflicts\u00a0but still remained\u00a0an integral part of the western European economy.\u00a0As\u00a0the neutral country was\u00a0busy dealing with its\u00a0ongoing civil war, it\u00a0became a political island whose historic development has been following a\u00a0\u201cspecial\u00a0path\u201d\u00a0ever since.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe next\u00a0stage of Swiss history\u00a0is\u00a0characterised\u00a0by the introduction of\u00a0a\u00a0kind\u00a0of external governance in Switzerland.\u00a0The fate of the country was first determined by Napoleon and\u00a0later\u00a0by the European powers\u00a0during\u00a0the Congress\u00a0of Vienna. This period is\u00a0considered\u00a0one of the\u00a0most unpopular\u00a0chapters in Swiss national history.\u00a0The Swiss do\u00a0not like to admit that all necessary political and social reforms\u00a0were only\u00a0introduced\u00a0after\u00a0French revolutionary troops invaded\u00a0in 1798.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe neutrality so strongly associated with modern Switzerland originated in a congress 200 years ago, when the Great Powers met in Vienna. \nThis means that Switzerland owes\u00a0quite a few of its achievements to\u00a0the French:\u00a0equality\u00a0of\u00a0all before the law; equal rights for\u00a0rural and urban citizens; equality of all cantons\u00a0and the abolition of\u00a0dividing them\u00a0into\u00a0\u201coriginal old cantons\u201d, on the one hand,\u00a0and \u201ccolonies\u201d, on the other.\u00a0The Swiss\u00a0also\u00a0don\u2019t like to mention that the creation of\u00a0neutral post-Napoleon\u00a0Switzerland needed the permission of the European powers during the\u00a0Congress of\u00a0Vienna in 1815.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe\u00a0Congress of Vienna\u00a0was followed by a\u00a0second\u00a0permanent and\u00a0slow\u00a0civil war that lasted\u00a0for about\u00a020 years. In 1847, this war reached its\u00a0peak\u00a0with\u00a0the so-called\u00a0\u201cSonderbund\u00a0War\u201d against the Catholic church. This war put an end to\u00a0a series of\u00a0local political conflicts\u00a0between the\u00a0Protestant liberals and Catholic democrats. The Protestants\u00a0thought\u00a0that the people should be enlightened and educated in the rational spirit of Protestant ethics\u00a0and that the creation of a unified state was of utmost importance.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nMany people are surprised when they hear that little Bern is the Swiss capital. Wouldn't industrial Zurich or international Geneva be more logical? \nCatholics\u00a0believed\u00a0that people should live\u00a0as\u00a0they wanted\u00a0and should\u00a0have the freedom\u00a0to\u00a0believe in\u00a0their (Catholic) religion. They stressed the importance of having sovereign cantons. In the end, the Protestants won the\u00a0\u201cSonderbund\u00a0War\u201d\u00a0and created a new Swiss federal state based on French human rights, German philosophy of the rule of law and English utilitarianism.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nHere's how, in 1918, Switzerland made the historic decision to move to a proportional representation system at national level. \n1848 marked the beginning of a new stage\u00a0characterised by a high standard of living\u00a0which has continued\u00a0to this day.\u00a0This\u00a0consistent historic development has lasted for more than 170 years\u00a0without\u00a0any\u00a0dramatic breaks\u00a0\u2013 a phenomenon that has no\u00a0analogies in the history of Europe.\u00a0\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nOn June 14, 1991, half a million women in Switzerland joined the first women\u2019s strike. Nearly 30 years later, they\u2019re mobilising again. \nArticles in this story\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

                "en_content": "Around 30% of the electricity produced globally is generated by sunshine, wind, water and other sustainable sources. In the year 2000, this figure stood at 20%. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that by 2050 almost 90% of electricity will be generated from renewable sources.\nSwitzerland already generates most of the electricity it consumes from renewable energies (75%), mainly via hydroelectric power stations. In recent years there has been an increase in photovoltaics, and to a lesser extent in wind power.\u00a0\nSolar panels are popping up all over the country, even in the most unthinkable places. Some Swiss entrepreneurs even want to produce solar energy on motorways.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nCovering motorways with solar panels sounds like an ideal solution to boost the uptake of solar power. How would it work? \nHowever, the electricity generated by solar and wind power is irregular and varies according to the seasons. Production can exceed demand, especially in summer. One of the main challenges of the energy transition is to develop systems capable of storing excess energy and returning it when it is needed.\nPumped-storage power\u00a0stations are the most effective and economical solution. They allow water to be pumped to a higher altitude when there is an excess energy, and to release generated electricity when there is a shortage.\nIn Switzerland there are about 100 reservoirs for hydroelectric production, and about 15 of them have a pumping system. Compared to other Alpine countries, such as Austria, Germany and Italy, Swiss power stations generally have larger water-retention basins and are therefore able to operate over longer periods, notes the Association of Swiss Electricity Companies.\nA new pumped-storage power station, one of the most powerful in Europe, has just come on stream in canton Valais in southern Switzerland. It will help compensate for fluctuations in solar and wind power on the continent.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nA new pumped-storage and turbine plant in Switzerland could give a significant boost to the development of renewable energies in Europe. \nAs the Alpine glaciers slowly melt away, Switzerland will have the opportunity to build new dams and artificial lakes in the mountains. This will increase energy storage capacity in the Alps, strengthening Switzerland's role as Europe's \u201celectricity battery\u201d.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nMelting glaciers could provide new opportunities for clean energy production in Switzerland. \nThe Swiss start-up Energy Vault follows the same principle as pumping and turbines. But instead of water, it uses concrete blocks. When there is a surplus of green electricity, these \"bricks\" are hoisted on top of each other to form a 120-metre tower. They are then \"dropped\" using gravity to generate electricity. The prototype built in canton Ticino, described below, has already attracted interest abroad.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nStacking blocks of concrete with a crane to store energy and use the force of gravity to keep producing electricity when renewable sources are... \nSurplus electricity can also be converted into liquid or gaseous energy sources. So-called 'power-to-x' technologies make it possible to use electricity from a solar power plant or a wind farm to produce hydrogen and then methane, for example. These two elements can be stored for a long time and used as fuels.\nSwitzerland wants to pave the way for emission-free mobility by replacing fossil fuels with green hydrogen. The world's first fleet of hydrogen-powered commercial trucks has been in operation in 2020.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nIn Switzerland a unique business venture is paving the way for emissions-free mobility by replacing fossil fuels with green hydrogen. \nIn the future, efficient cost-effective systems will also be needed to handle small amounts of energy quickly and with the least possible environmental impact. Switzerland is taking part in the European research initiative Battery 2030, which aims to improve the longevity and energy density of conventional lithium-ion batteries so that fewer rare metals are used.\nStationary systems that can stockpile renewable energy are also set for massive expansion in the coming decades. Lithium-ion and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) batteries are already being used to store solar and wind energy produced in homes. Scientists are now exploring alternatives that use zinc, vanadium or sodium, for example, which are proving to be well-suited for stationary storage. But they need to be scaled up to meet rising demand and to become cost competitive.\nEmpa is one of twelve partners involved in the European SOLSTICE battery project together with Swiss firms FZSONICK and Quantis. Their aim is to develop sodium-zinc molten salt batteries operating at high temperatures that can be used to store energy.\nCorsin Battaglia, an expert at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA), explains Switzerland's role: \u201cWhether it\u2019s materials, cell and pack integration, electronics, battery management systems, recycling and mobility or stationary storage, there are lots of companies in Switzerland that are active in the batteries field or even world leaders.\u201d\nMore\n\n\n\n\nMajor European and Swiss research initiatives are trying to meet demand for battery innovation and energy storage. \nArticles in this story\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

But as the years passed, the public began to realise that what was once the realm of science fiction had become a proven reality: the galaxy is teaming not only with stars, but also with planets. The first to have identified one of these planets orbiting a star other than our sun were none other than Switzerland\u2019s own Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz. \u00a0\nAnd 24 years later, the discovery earned Mayor and Queloz the Nobel Prize for physics.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nJoint winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, Didier Queloz talks about waiting for the call from Sweden and how the award has changed his life. \nExcitement aside, the Nobel Prize is certainly justified. The discovery was one of the most important in astronomy in the 20th century. It opened new fields of research for understanding our place in the universe and it multiplied by millions the chances of finding extra-terrestrial life.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nOn October 6, 1995, Michel Mayor and Didier Qu\u00e9loz announced the discovery of the first planet orbiting a star other than our sun. \nBut the search for other lifeforms is not an easy task when we are looking for it on distant worlds that are hundreds of thousands of billons of kilometres away.

                "en_content": "\u201cAs seen centuries ago, the [Covid-19] pandemic is bringing anti-Semitic clich\u00e9s to the surface,\u201d declared Jonathan Kreutner, secretary general of the Swiss Federation of Jewish Communities (FSCI) in 2021, the middle of the Covid-19 health crisis.\nThat year, the FSCI and the Federal Commission against Racism (FCR) published a report on anti-Semitism showing that Jewish people continue to be singled out when times are difficult. \u201cAs in the past, Jews are very quickly identified as culprits,\u201d it stated.\u00a0\nAnti-Semitic stereotypes appear regularly in Switzerland. According to a 2020 survey by the Federal Statistical Office, 39% of the Swiss population resort to the use of Jewish stereotypes as people who are power-hungry, money-grabbers or politically radical.\nCloser study of Swiss refugee policy during the Second World War reveals that from the end of the 19th century the treatment of Jewish people was shaped by immigration strategies aimed at protecting the country from \u201cJewish foreign overpopulation\u201d.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nArchive documents from September 1942 show how the government\u2019s policy of turning away Jews at the Swiss border was controversial at the time. \nDespite the publication of the first newspaper articles about the Holocaust in the 1960s, for years the Shoah remained a non-issue in Switzerland. However, in 1995 Switzerland\u2019s past caught up with it. It began with a legal complaint filed in the United States by Holocaust survivors who had been unable to access Swiss bank accounts that belonged to them.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe call for a Swiss memorial to the Shoah is receiving broad political support for the first time. \nSwiss banks finally agreed to pay CHF1.25 billion ($1.26 billion) in compensation to the victims of the Holocaust and their descendants. This was followed by unprecedented research into the history of Switzerland during the Second World War - the Bergier report.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nIt has been 20 years since Swiss banks agreed to compensate Holocaust victims for assets lost during the Second World War. \nSwitzerland was however divided over the issue: in a poll carried out in 1997 by the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, SWI swissinfo.ch\u2019s parent company, 53% of those questioned said the demands made on Switzerland were totally legitimate, but 47% thought they should be rejected.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSWI swissinfo.ch spoke to historian Stefan Keller about how well Switzerland has been dealing with its past. \nFormer cabinet minister Jean-Pascal Delamuraz resorted to anti-Semitic stereotypes to describe foreign demands as \u201cblackmail\u2026 from certain circles\u201d who wanted to \u201cdestabilise\u201d the Swiss financial industry. He was applauded for his comments in many newspapers\u2019 readers\u2019 sections.\nThe Federal Commission against Racism noted at the time that anti-Semitic sentiment, which had previously only existed in the background, had become much more vivid during the debate.\nThe tales that fuelled hatred of the Jews originated in Europe in the High Middle Ages (around the late 10th to early 14th centuries) and led to the persecution and destruction of Jewish communities, including in Switzerland. Anti-Semitism in Europe was motivated by religious and economic factors \u2013 images that still circulate today. At the time Jews were accused of being carriers of disease and child-killers and were persecuted as loan sharks. In the 15\n century, Jews were expelled from most towns in the Swiss Confederation, as in the rest of Europe.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe Covid pandemic has once again shown that nearly all conspiracy theories blame the Jews for the evils of the world. \nThe recognition of Jews as Swiss citizens with equal rights met resistance until the 19th century. Jewish people were vilified as the descendants of Judas. Up until 1866, they were legally considered as foreigners in Switzerland. Compared with other European countries, their emancipation came relatively late.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nFor centuries, Jewish life in what is now Switzerland was marked by discrimination. \nHatred towards Jewish people evolved from religious intolerance to an explanation for modern problems. Jews were blamed for unwelcome changes and the ancient image of the greedy Jew was adapted to the times.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1930s, anti-Semitic protests against Jewish-owned department stores led the government to ban their expansion. \nAnti-Semitism is not associated with any particular political orientation or social class. Even left-wing criticism of Israel sometimes crosses the line.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nAnti-Semitism is widespread in Swiss society, even within the political left. \n\"A toxic mix can emerge if you don't objectively criticise Israel's policies and hypothesise that immoral behaviour has a direct link with Jewishness\", says Erik Petry, the deputy head of the Centre for Jewish Studies at the University of Basel. He has seen some examples of this venomous mix among people on the left.\n\u201cAnti-Semitism is a master of metamorphosis,\u201d says Dina Wyler, managing director of the Foundation against Racism and Anti-Semitism. \u201cIt adapts to the current narrative and often comes to the surface by way of images or buzzwords. In this way it remains \u2018socially acceptable\u2019\".\nArticles in this story\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

The contaminated snow absorbed more solar energy and melted faster. Finally, the exceptional summer heatwave resulted in record temperatures even at high altitudes.",

What is surprising, however, is the rate at which the Alpine \u201cgiants\u201d are shrinking.\u00a0\n\"The retreat of glaciers is accelerating,\" says Daniel Farinotti, a glaciologist at the federal technology institute ETH Zurich, and member of the steering committee of GLAMOS, the Swiss glacier monitoring network.\nA study published this summer concludes that Swiss glaciers lost half their volume between 1931 and 2016 and a further 12% between 2016 and 2021.\nThe year 2022 was exceptional. There are basically three reasons for the strong retreat of the glaciers this year, according to experts. One is the low snowfall in winter and spring. Another is sand from the Sahara Desert that blew all the way to Switzerland between March and May and deposited on ice and snow. The contaminated snow absorbed more solar energy and melted faster. Finally, the exceptional summer heatwave resulted in record temperatures even at high altitudes.\nThe summer of 2022 was the second-warmest in Switzerland since measurements began in 1864. On July 25, the zero-degree line \u2013 the height at which the temperature goes into the minus - was recorded at an altitude of 5,184 metres. The previous record (5,117 metres) was on July 20, 1995, MeteoSwiss reported.\n\u201cFor Swiss glaciers, 2022 will go down in history as the worst of all,\u201d said Farinotti.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwiss glaciers have lost more than 6% of their volume this year. The decline smashed previous record retreats, but it was not entirely negative. \nFollowing the record temperatures in the Alps, objects, human remains and the wreckage of a plane trapped in the ice for over 50 years have emerged.\u00a0These discoveries are set to increase in the coming years, according to Robert Bolognesi, a snow scientist and director of Meteorisk.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s melting glaciers have revealed more unexpected, macabre secrets this summer: human remains and plane wreckage trapped in the ice. \nSince the pre-industrial era, the temperature in Switzerland has increased by almost 2\u00b0\u00a0Celsius,\u00a0twice the\u00a0global\u00a0average. At this rate, half of the 1,500\u00a0Alpine glaciers\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including the majestic Aletsch glacier, a UNESCO heritage site\u00a0\u2013\u00a0will disappear in the next 30 years. And if nothing is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, all glaciers in Switzerland and Europe risk melting almost completely by the end of the century, researchers warn.\u00a0\nGlaciers are retreating not only in the Alps. Almost all glaciers worldwide\u00a0are becoming thinner and losing mass faster and faster. The melting is particularly alarming in the Himalaya\u00a0region and in the Andes, where\u00a0hundreds of millions of people depend\u00a0on glaciers.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nOn average, Switzerland is about 1.9\u00b0 Celsius hotter now than in 1864. Where and by how much have temperatures most drastically changed? \nHowever, there are exceptions. Some glaciers in central Asia seem not to suffer the effects of global warming, and their surface, instead of shrinking, has remained stable or has even grown. A Swiss project intends to investigate the reasons behind this\u00a0anomaly.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSome glaciers in Central Asia appear to be unaffected by global warming. A Swiss project is investigating why. \nWill the decline of glaciers, a\u00a0recurrent\u00a0phenomenon\u00a0throughout Earth\u2019s\u00a0history\u00a0\u2013\u00a0albeit\u00a0over longer periods\u00a0\u2013 have a negative impact on\u00a0our future?\u00a0It\u2019s hard\u00a0to say. It certainly forces us to prepare for new scenarios.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland's melting glaciers are set to affect the agriculture sector, hydropower production and transport on Europe\u2019s main waterways. \nIn Switzerland, one\u00a0such\u00a0scenario\u00a0is the increased risk of natural disasters such as floods, debris flows and landslides. The lakes that form\u00a0inside glaciers\u00a0risk suddenly\u00a0spilling downhill, wiping out villages and infrastructure.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nMelting of the glaciers means more risk of landslides and flooding. Yet it is also opening up new opportunities for Alpine tourism. \nAnd with the thinning of the ice and the permafrost layer, the mountains\u00a0are becoming\u00a0less stable.\u00a0Images of the subsidence of the Alpine slopes\u00a0are\u00a0revealing.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nMove the slider left and right to see how major glaciers in the Alps have dramatically changed over the past century. \nWith the melting of glaciers, Switzerland is also losing a major water reserve, estimated to contain enough drinking water for the Swiss population for 60 years.\nOf course,\u00a0Switzerland will continue to have\u00a0enough\u00a0water, even if its population\u00a0rises\u00a0from the current 8.5\u00a0million\u00a0to\u00a0ten\u00a0million in 2050. However, it will be necessary to\u00a0change\u00a0the methods of managing\u00a0rainfall\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which will become increasingly liquid\u00a0and less snowy \u2013\u00a0to avoid\u00a0water\u00a0conflicts,\u00a0says\u00a0Paolo\u00a0Burlando, professor of hydrology and water management at the\u00a0federal technology institute ETH Zurich. The creation of multipurpose storage basins in the mountains, in areas free from ice, could offer new opportunities for hydroelectric production and agriculture.\u00a0\nAccording to a scenario developed by ETH Zurich and the Federal Research Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape WSL, the complete melting of glaciers could generate 683 new lakes in the Alps.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nMelting glaciers could provide new opportunities for clean energy production in Switzerland. \nThe situation in Europe could be more problematic, especially in regions located hundreds of kilometres from the Alps. Due to the lower contribution of melting snow and glaciers, the flow of large European rivers \u2013 the Rh\u00f4ne, Rhine, Danube and Po \u2013 could decrease considerably in the summer months. A drop in the level of rivers and lakes will make it harder to travel by water and to transport goods to and from Switzerland.\nTo preserve\u00a0this\u00a0heritage of national importance that has helped make Switzerland known worldwide, scientists have\u00a0undertaken a race against time. On\u00a0the\u00a0Morteratsch\u00a0glacier in canton Graub\u00fcnden\u00a0in eastern Switzerland,\u00a0a project has been launched to protect the glacier with artificial snow;\u00a0a system that,\u00a0if successful,\u00a0can also be used in the Himalayas and the Andes.\u00a0\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe Swiss are going to enormous lengths to protect their shrinking glaciers from further erosion. \nIn order to slow down the melting of the ice, geotextile sheets are also increasingly used in the Alps. Placed on the glacier, they reflect sunlight and help preserve the snow and ice below. While they can be effective and profitable locally, their wider use is neither feasible nor cost-effective, according to a Swiss study published in 2021.\nBut science\u00a0won\u2019t be able to do anything\u00a0if greenhouse gas emissions\u00a0continue to\u00a0rise. In Switzerland, the struggle to protect glaciers\u00a0is\u00a0thus shifting\u00a0from the mountains to political chambers and ballot boxes.\nIn the autumn session, the Swiss parliament adopted the counter-proposal to the popular initiative \"For a healthy climate\" (Glaciers Initiative), which includes measures to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The initiative has been withdrawn, but the\u00a0referendum has already been launched against the changes to the law envisaged by the counter-proposal.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nCould melting ice release potentially harmful bacteria and viruses into the atmosphere? \nMore\n\n\n\n\nSajama National Park in Bolivia has lost more than half of its glacier over the past 30 years. A Swiss project aims to preserve the meltwater. \nMore\n\n\n\n\nNew images from the book \u201cAletsch \u2013 Der gr\u00f6sste Gletscher der Alpen\u201c (Aletsch \u2013 the biggest glacier in the Alps) by Valais-based photographer Marco... \nArticles in this story\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

It is not pleasant to wake up like that, but we already know what to do then. From the time the alarm goes off, we have one and a half minutes to get into a bunker.\nBut there is no such shelter in the old building where we live. We go into the stairwell, crouching as far away from glass as possible. The stairwell is the most stable part of a building.\nWhen the Iron Dome shield intercepts the missile, you hear a boom. Then you are supposed to wait another ten minutes. Saturday morning we experienced a few alarms, then three more in the evening. Since then it has been quieter. Just now I heard another missile alarm, but not directly in our neighbourhood.\nM.H: Exactly. The international high-tech company where I work supports us a lot in this situation. We can work when we can. My colleagues in Israel are mostly on-off at the moment because many of them have to look after children at the same time. Friends of a colleague are missing.\nMany of my colleagues had to join the army as reservists. Working is good for me. It distracts me and otherwise I would be constantly scrolling around and be exposed to the pictures in the news and social media.\nM.H: I don't comment on such things. I get personally annoyed when I see something.\nM.H: I haven't heard of anyone who lives here and is thinking of leaving. But my colleague in the Council of the Swiss Abroad seems to have received a lot of calls. For me, going back would not be an option either.\nLike most Swiss people in Israel, I am a dual citizen. In 2014 I immigrated with the help of Aliyah, the Israeli state service that supports all Jewish people to move to Israel and obtain citizenship. So I'm not thinking about returning to Switzerland, but I also see myself as Swiss, as a Swiss Abroad. That's why I'm also involved in this community.\nM.H: On Saturday evening, we received a helpful email from the embassy informing us how to register on the TravelAdmin app. But of course this was addressed to Swiss citizens living here - not to those who are here on holiday.\nFor tourists, it was probably more challenging. I heard from one corner that some people didn't know how to get in touch with the embassy. Of course, it is important that everyone who wants to go home can be flown out. I find it very difficult.\nAt the moment, it seems to be open whether there will still be emergency flights from Switzerland. However, I am hardly involved in this, but try to be there for Swiss people who live here if they have a problem.\nSwitzerland absolutely must recognise Hamas as a terrorist organisation. I read in the media that the parliamentary \"Switzerland-Palestine Friendship Group\" is about to come to an end. I think that's good.\u00a0\u00a0\nA criticism I have is that until Monday afternoon no one from the Federal Council had yet clearly condemned the Hamas attack. Maybe that's not possible because of neutrality, but I find that questionable.\nM.H: Coming forward is the only thing you can do. You can write to us and think of us. In Israel we support each other mentally. But I also get a lot of messages from Switzerland and a lot of people get in touch with my parents who live in Switzerland. That is also good for my parents. The sympathy is very great.\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: ",

                "en_content": "Federal elections are imminent. The Swiss who live within the national borders can fill out their electoral ballots for weeks. And many have already been sent back to the commune for a long time.\nBut what about the 221\u2019448 Swiss abroad with the right to vote? On the occasion of these federal elections too, we receive angry messages from all over the world informing us that documents have not yet arrived or have arrived late. In some cases, it was not possible to send them back on time by mail. This is not an exception to other elections and voting.\nThe Fifth Switzerland feels unable to participate in democratic life. A fact that regularly gives rise to parliamentary interventions and amendment proposals. Last March, the Federal Council released a\nin which various attempts to improve were analyzed.\nThe sending of voting material to the Swiss abroad is regulated at the level of the order. It can be sent as soon as one week before the official sending to Switzerland, that is, six weeks before the vote. This year, sending to the Swiss abroad was authorized as early as the week following September 11 (week 37 of the calendar).\n\u201cAs in the past, the Federal Council has asked the cantons, in its circular to the cantonal governments, to ensure that the electoral documents for the Swiss abroad are sent before the official sending within the country,\u201d says the Federal Chancellery in writing.\nWe wanted to know whether the cantons had complied with this request and when they had sent the documents to Swiss citizens abroad.\nSuch a survey is not so simple to realize. Indeed, fourteen cantons manage the electoral register of the Swiss abroad in a decentralized way \u2013 that is, each municipality for itself. In nine cantons, the electoral register is managed by the cantonal administration, in three cantons, the responsibility lies with the administration of the township chief township.\nAll 26 cantons responded to the demand for swissinfo.ch. Twelve of the fourteen cantons in which the municipalities are responsible for the consignment communicated the date of sending in the township chief township.\nThe canton of Argovie is the model student among the cantons, according to our survey. While the earliest possible date set by the Confederation was September 11, the canton of Argovie sent the documents on September 8, 2023, at the end of week 36 of the calendar (there was a weekend between the two).\nIs that a problem? Maria B\u00fchlmann, who holds the electoral register of the Swiss abroad in the canton of Argovie (ZASR), is sure that this is not the case. She calculates from the poll weekend, on Friday night making her eyes part of the weekend. The canton of Argovie thus respected the six weeks allowed before the voting weekend.\n\"For many years, we have set a deadline to deliver the documents to the post on Friday night,\" she said. These shipments must first be sorted before the documents can be actually sent.\n\u201cI make sure that the documents will not be sent in the course of week 37 of the calendar, but precisely the first day it is possible,\u201d explains Maria B\u00fchlmann. In this way, she hopes to give \u201cits\u201d Switzerland from abroad \u2013 especially on the other side of the Atlantic \u2013 the chance to participate in elections and voting.\nBut behind this approach there is also a reflection on security, the ergonomic leader emphasizes. \"The documentation sent contains sensitive data from the point of view of data protection,\" she recalls. Therefore, by placing the mail on Friday, it is La Poste who assumes responsibility for it during the weekend of this more than 3.7 tons of equipment, until the time of the shipment, on Monday.\nIn the canton of Argovia, more than 12\u2019500 Swiss abroad are now registered \u2013 the head of the ZASR would, however, like \u201cits\u201d Swiss abroad to participate more in the votes. Indeed, even if the documents are sent early, all the Swiss from abroad registered do not participate in elections and voting.\nArgovia is one of the cantons that would like to send voting and election materials even earlier. According to the March 2023 report of the Federal Council, most cantons indicated that this was in principle possible at home.\nBut it's stuck at the Confederation level. \u201cThe process of\nfrom the explanatory brochure to the printing of voting material requires several months at a very sustained pace,\u201d reads the report of the Federal Council. In order to allow a shipment earlier than six weeks before the day of the election or voting, important organizational interventions should be carried out in the course of production, something that is not possible as easily in a system that has been operating for years.\nBut the problem of electoral documents sent too late does not disappear easily. \"These six weeks are often not enough; the overseas shipment sometimes requires up to four weeks,\u201d explains Maria B\u00fchlmann. A reference in time is no longer possible for the Swiss abroad.\nFor the 2023 federal elections, citizens and citizens of the foreign country registered in Basel City, Saint-Gall and Thurgovie will not have this problem of dismissal. They are certainly dependent on a consignment in time. But as they can vote by electronic vote this year, the deadline for removal will be deleted.\nOf the 26 cantons, they sent the documents in the course of week 37, and they respected the instructions of the Confederation. Only the cantons in the Jura (3102 Swiss abroad with the right to vote) and Soleur (4195) were able to send the voting material only during week 38. Why?\n\u201cUnfortunately, the folding has been delayed, which is why the shipment was only possible during week 38 of the calendar,\u201d writes Pascale von Roll, vice-secretary of State of the Chancellery of the canton of Soleure, interviewed in this regard.\nIn the canton of Jura, \u201ca problem in the delivery of part of the documentation\u201d resulted in a delay in the distribution of the material to the municipalities. \u201cFor this reason, the sending of voting material for the municipalities was carried out until 18 September 2023\u201d, says the Secretariat of the Chancellery of State of the Canton of Jura. However, the extent of the delay is not known to the cantonal authorities. The canton of Jura is one of the fourteen cantons in which municipalities send voting equipment.\nThe documents were sent as soon as possible in week 38, more than a week later than the Federal Council wished. Des jours qui manquentes aux Suisses de l\u2019 \u00e9trangers des cantons de Soleure et du Jura pour participer aux \u00e9lections.\nMore\nDiscussion\nSwitzerland and Switzerland from abroad, tell us your experience, whether you want electronically or by correspondence.\nMore\n\nIn comparison to other countries, Switzerland is distinguished by its legendary stability.

                "en_content": "Hydrogen is widely considered a key element of the energy transition. It could replace the gasoline of cars and aircraft kerosene, contributing to a mobility free of CO2 emissions. But there's a problem. Its production generates emissions that are harmful to the climate. More than 90% of the world\u2019s hydrogen comes from fossil sources, mainly methane. Alternatives exist well, such as hydrogen obtained from renewable energies, but in the state, they are costly.\nAs a result, interest is focused on natural hydrogen and the possibility of extracting it from the basement. In the United States, Australia and Spain, start-ups are already conducting drilling projects. And the recent discovery of a\nis the demonstration that this gas is less rare than we thought. Switzerland could also house natural hydrogen reserves. The results of the first analyses are promising.\nHere\u2019s what we need to know about this gas, its characteristics and its potential as a future-bearing fuel.\nThe Earth produces hydrogen continuously as part of chemical reactions. The main ones are the oxidation of iron-rich minerals and the radiolysis of water, in other words the scission of water molecules as a result of natural radioactivity. These reactions release hydrogen molecules (H2), generally present in combination with other elements, such as oxygen for water (H2O). Hydrogen goes up to the surface and accumulates in underground deposits.\nProperties and chemical composition are identical. In both cases, there is an odorless and highly flammable gas. The difference lies in the mode of production. Natural hydrogen, called hydrogen\n, is generated in the depths of the earth's crust while its synthetic twin is made by chemical and industrial processes.\nIf hydrogen combustion does not generate emissions, its production releases CO2, the synthetic hydrogen being obtained from fossil fuels. We then talk about hydrogen\n. If the production is done in the factory with capture and sequester of the carbon dioxide emitted, we speak of hydrogen\n.\nHydrogen is also obtained by electrolysis, a process using electricity to divide the water molecule into its two constituent elements, namely hydrogen and oxygen. If the electricity in question comes from renewable sources, such as photovoltaic or wind, hydrogen receives the designation as renewable sources\n.\nHydrogen is as much a vector as a source of energy. Its combustion does not generate CO2 emissions and only produces water. On equal mass, a hydrogen molecule contains about\n. Hydrogen can be used to power cars, trucks and aircraft equipped with fuel cell. The animation below shows the operation:\nNatural hydrogen has the advantage of being an almost inexhaustible resource. The processes leading to its formation are much faster \u2013 a few decades or a few hundred years \u2013 than those presiding over the transformation of organic matter into oil, which take millions of years. Hydrogen deposits could regenerate at a pace to ensure continuous operation.\nMoreover, its cost is interesting, being estimated at\n(USD/kg). It would therefore be cheaper than its equivalents produced from fossil sources (0.5-1.7 USD/kg) or renewable energy (3-8 USD/kg).\n\u201cNatural hydrogen has the potential to become a new source of energy important to the world,\u201d says\n, member of the United States Geological Survey (US Geological Survey).\nAnother decade ago, natural hydrogen reserves were considered almost non-existent or inaccessible. Everything changed in 2012 with the discovery of a deposit in Mali. In this African country, hydrogen is directly burned on site to produce electricity for a small village.\nThe discovery gave impetus to prospecting efforts and in May of this year, the hexagonal company the French of Energy announced the update of a deposit in Lorraine, in the northeast of the country. The reservoir could contain 46 million tons of hydrogen, the equivalent of half of the hydrogen produced in the world every year.\nNumerous regions have geological characteristics that are conducive to hydrogen formation - presence of ferrous minerals, temperatures above 200 degrees Celsius and water infiltration. In addition to the United States, Australia, France and Spain, the most promising areas are in Russia, Canada, Oman, Japan and China.\nGeoffrey Ellis considers that a large part of natural hydrogen is confined to too much depth or too far from the coast to be exploited in a cost-effective manner. However, it notes that the exploitation of only a fraction of the estimated global reserves could provide enough hydrogen for centuries.\nGeological maps and chemical measurements of gases in the soil suggest the presence of natural hydrogen in Switzerland and the alpine region in general. \u201cWe found rocks that produced hydrogen in the past. It is now a matter of seeing in depth whether there is still a capacity to generate it today,\u201d explains geochemist Eric Gaucher, co-founder of the start-up Lavoisier H2 Geoconsult.\nThe collision of the tectonic plates, at the origin of the formation of the Alps, brought close to the surface of the iron-rich rocks of the earth\u2019s coat. The first results of the research conducted by Eric Gaucher in recent months in the Grisons and Valais appear promising. The depths of the soil could receive \"hydrogen cooks\", i.e. production sites. The next step will be to get the funds needed to finance a thesis work and to evaluate the real potential, says Eric Gaucher.\nImagine Switzerland as a future of hydrogen Qatar, however, is quite premature, underlines the geochemist. There is currently a scientific interest in pursuing the studies, but in the state, nowhere on the planet, it has been shown that the exploitation of natural hydrogen can be profitable, with the exception of the Icelandic geothermal wells, says the director of Lavoisier H2 Geoconsult.\nIn any event, allowing the exploration of hydrogen in Switzerland would first require an amendment of the legislation, and more specifically the mining code, as France undertook last year. In Switzerland, it is up to the cantons to decide whether they authorize this type of research in their territory.\nHydrogen is not free from inconvenience, says Nathan Solothurmann of Greenpeace Switzerland. This is a volatile substance with a significant risk of leakage. In the atmosphere, its negative impact on the climate is eleven times more important than that of CO2, he explains daily\n. The exploration, storage and transport phase also requires infrastructure that may have a negative impact on the environment.\nIn the view of the Greenpeace representative, natural hydrogen should be used to replace methane in certain chemical processes, such as fertilizer production. But considering using it on a large scale as fuel is a \u201cdangerous illusion\u201d, he believes.\nMore\n\nAlpine glaciers could disappear by the end of the century. The consequences will be felt throughout Europe.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

Witnesses remember a woman with mediation skills. \u201cShe fought for photography,\u201d says Rolf Sachsse, photographer and professor at the \u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts de la Sarre, Germany.\nIn the October 1974 issue of the Swiss German cultural magazine\n, his editor-in-chief, Manuel Gasser, said that \u201cthe need to create an institution in Switzerland to defend the interests of photography was first put forward by Rosellina Burri-Bischof, who became the engine of this foundation from his firstfruits\u201d. A renowned German journalist and writer, Hugo Loetscher had confirmed in the international journal\nthat she was indeed the main working ankle, and not him. But before the official appearance of the Swiss Foundation for Photography in 1971, she had already fought as a lion for almost twenty years in favor of a better diffusion of this art in Switzerland, carried by her passion for photography and her sense of professionalism.\nIn 1946, shortly after the Second World War, this unique child born on June 5, 1925 of the union of a couple of Hungarian Jewish emigrants, Moses and Anna Mandel, had worked for the \u201cCentro Educativo Italo-Svizzero\u201d in Rimini, Italy, after having spent his youth in Zurich. She had to take care of orphans traumatized by the war. While she still bore the name of Rosa Mandel and her friends in Switzerland continued to call her R\u00f6sli, who became Rosellina in Italy, it was precisely in Rimini that she became acquainted with Swiss photographer Werner Bischof, who then went on to report to this centre.\nAccording to their eldest son Marco, born after their marriage in May 1949, his mother had already begun to take care of her husband\u2019s administrative tasks in the shadows. She had also accompanied her in her peregrine in Europe, Asia, Japan, Mexico and the United States.\nOn 16 May 1954, the tragic announcement of the accidental death of Werner Bischof, aged only 38, plunged Zurich into sadness and consternation. A member of the young Magnum agency and already enjoying as an international aura, he had succumbed to a fall in a precipice by taking steep paths through the Peruvian mountains. The geologist who accompanied him and his driver also lost life on these Andean roads. \"Ni sur le meilleur ni sur le plus des chemins de la r\u00e9gion\", noted Manuel Gasser in\n(En Route), a biography he had dedicated to Bischof and his photographs. This book was published in 1957 by a Rosellina Bischof who became a widow and raised his two sons alone, including Daniel, born nine days after the accident. She spoiled her heritage from there.\nBenefiting from a good international network, she even organized six months later the opening of an itinerant exhibition dedicated to her work of photographs\n. Two years later, she took the lead of Magnum Switzerland, which was still a cooperative (Magnum Photos), but defending a humanist and socially critical photograph.\nThen the pivotal dates went on. In 1956, Rosellina Bischof and the Parisian publisher Robert Delpire persuaded the Museum of Decorative Arts in Zurich to organize a retrospective dedicated to photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson. Then a year later, she launched a travelling exhibition with the same museum by Werner Bischof. Then presented in 1961 to the Swiss public the war photographs of Robert Capa, a retrospective then resumed in New York. These three exhibitions had been able to raise the awareness of this art of photography. And it was only a beginning.\nIn 1958 she had already been able to transfer the exhibition to this Zurich museum\npresented three years earlier in New York by the then star photographer Edward Steichen, his model. About ten years earlier, in 1947, the latter had been appointed to the head of the Photography Department of the Modern Art Museum of New York, the MoMa, where collections of photos had been collected since the 1930s did not depict in the midst of other artistic forms. But in Switzerland, no one had yet tried to arrange this kind of collections as professionally as the photograph was still in the society with in particular the monthly magazine\n, which was looking over the news of filmography, a magazine available then by subscription.\nIn those years also, photography professor Hans Finsler and his colleague Alfred Willimann formed some of the future great names of Swiss photography: Werner Bischof, Ernst Scheidegger and Ren\u00e9 Burri. Considered as one of the initiators of photojournalism and reporting in Switzerland, Arnold K\u00fcbler encouraged artists such as Annemarie Schwarzenbach or Paul Senn to persevere in this path.\nIn 1963, Rosellina Bischof married Ren\u00e9 Burri, another photographer attached to the Magnum agency. Two children will be born from this union, Yasmine and Olivier. The name of Rosellina Burri-Bischof now had close links with this agency as well as with many other photographers, as well as with the Center of Photography based in New York.\nIn 1966, Robert Capa\u2019s brother Cornell Capa created a foundation in Big Apple, first known as Bischof-Capa-Seymour Memorial Foundation, which had the names of three of the most important photographers of Magnum who lost their lives in the exercise of their profession. Rosellina Burri-Bischof was then appointed to the Foundation Council. Renamed \"International Fund for Concerned Photography\", this institution organized two years later a first exhibition in New York. Then Cornell Capa gave Rosellina Burri-Bischof the mission to present her in Zurich. What she did in 1970 at the \u201cHeidi Weber Museum-Centre Le Corbusier\u201d at the H\u00f6schgasse, in the Seefeld district, was a great success. All the gratin of photographers from Paris and New York made the trip for the opening.\nInitially planned as a Swiss branch of this New York organization, the Photography Foundation was able to fly its own wings as a Swiss institution in its entirety, and this in May 1971. In addition to Rosellina Burri-Bischof in the baguette, seven other personalities related to the world of photography also participated in his creation, including Manuel Gasser who was the first president.\nThe Swiss Foundation for Photography contains a collection of some 50,000 original prints and some fifty posthumous repositories related to successions. With the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019\u00c9lys\u00e9e in Lausanne, it is considered the main institution for photography in Switzerland.\nIncorporated within the Zurich cultural scene, the latter could also rely on strong business and industry relations. Together with Rosellina Burri-Bischof, the two succeed in the successful negotiations to ensure that the Kunsthaus in Zurich hosts their foundation. There was nothing in Switzerland that opposed the creation of a department dedicated to photography, like what was already happening at the MoMa in New York. It was in the B\u00fchrle room of the Kunsthaus that the exhibition titled in the autumn of 1974 was organized.\n, the first inventory of photographic creation in Switzerland. This retrospective traveled for several years with the general enthusiasm.\nJournalist and founder in the 1980s of the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019\u00c9lys\u00e9e in Lausanne, Charles-Henri Favrod contributed to the catalogue of the museum. From now on, there is also a new lucarne in Western Switzerland. Thanks to her intergent, Rosellina Burri-Bischof had a decisive role, maintaining professional and warm relations in the world of the photo.\nInside the \u201cPhoto-Galerie\u201d space installed at the Kunsthaus in Zurich, she proposed up to seven exhibitions per year, highlighting both the work of Swiss photographers and those of the great international names of the photo, as well as omitting the precursors. The Zurich photographer emigrated to New York Robert Frank, to whom Manuel Gasser had dedicated in 1962 a special notebook in\n, was the first to benefit from an individual exhibition in 1976. From 1971 to 1981, Rosellina Burri-Bischof organized with its foundation no less than 36 exhibitions.\nIt was in this year that photography opened to the general public in Switzerland, making Rosellina Burri-Bischof a pioneer. Art galleries began to be interested in photography, including the Stockeregg Gallery in Zurich, founded in 1979. It is true that the exhibitions at the Kunsthaus had sharpened the appetite of the collectors.\nRosellina Burri-Bischof died in 1986 without being able to attend the retrospective devoted to her first husband Werner Bischof at the Kunsthaus in Zurich. An event she had worked on for two years. Without its hard work, no doubt that the photo would have known such a boom in Switzerland.\nMore\n\nThe use of anti-Semitic explanations during crises has lasted for centuries.

If for you, these developments in the form of big eight make the salt of democracy, you can quietly ignore the Swiss elections.\nWithin the Confederation, the publication of an electoral survey, the observers dissimilar the large decline of the Greens or the progress of the Democratic Union of the Centre. Decline? In October, the first would lose 2.5% of the vote compared to 2019 and the second would win 1% of the vote according to the last temperature taken by the March electorate. All with an error margin of 1.2 percentage point...\nMore\n\n\n\n\nGreat winners of the 2019 federal election, environmentalists are losing speed.\nBecause if there is something that characterizes the Swiss Parliament, it is its extraordinary stability. Not that his composition remained identical for 175 years, on the contrary. Over the past two decades, for example, the Democratic Union of the Centre has made significant progress, reaching almost triple its electoral surface from 1991 to 2015. Two new forces also appeared: the Green-e-s and the Green Liberal Party. Two formations which, on the contrary, more or less ephemeral in Swiss political history, seem not intended to disappear soon.\nBut in the midst of comparable Western democracies, the evolution of the equilibrium within the Confederation is more tectonic than telluric, as can be seen on this chart which summarizes the strength of the parties in the People\u2019s Chamber (National Council), elected to the proportional system since 1919.\nThe Federal Assembly \u2013 the official name of the Swiss Parliament \u2013 consists of two chambers: the Council of States, which represents the cantons and counts 46 elected-e-s, and the National Council, the expression of the people, with 200 members.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nEvery four years, the Swiss vote to renew their Parliament. A video to explain the system.\nThis bicameral system, established in 1848 after the birth of the federal state, is based on the model of the United States of America. Both legislative bodies have the same powers and each decision requires the approval of both chambers.\nThe number of representatives to the Council of States did not vary: two \u201csenators\u201d or \u201csenators\u201d per canton and one-e for each of the six half-cantons. In other words, 44 members until 1978 and 46 since 1979 and the entry of the canton of Jura newly created in the Confederation.\nOn the contrary, the National Council has undergone several changes. He had 111 members in 1848. Each member of Parliament (the male was elected on the understanding that the first women were elected to Parliament in 1971 after the introduction of female suffrage) represented some 20,000 inhabitants (including foreigners). Population growth has resulted in a gradual increase in the number of electives. Since 1962, it has been set at 200. Today, each member of the National Council represents about 40,000 inhabitants.\nEach canton has a number of national advisers and national advisers proportional to its population. For example, Zurich is entitled to 35 seats. Appenzell Rhodes-Int\u00e9rieures and other small cantons with one. It is relatively common that either canton loses or wins a seat according to its demographic evolution.\nThe Council of States, as an expression of the cantons, is elected according to cantonal law. In theory, each canton can therefore decide to elect its representatives when and how it wishes. In fact, the elections for the Chamber of Cantons are held at the same time as those of the National Council, with the exception of Appenzell Rhodes-Int\u00e9rieures, who appoints his or her representative in April prior to the federal elections.\nIn Neuch\u00e2tel and in the Jura, the elected members of the Council of States may also be elected by the resident-e-s who are not in possession of the Swiss passport. These two cantons are the only ones in the country to grant the right to vote to foreigners on the cantonal level.\nThe elections for the Council of States take place almost everywhere in the majority system. Only the cantons of Neuch\u00e2tel and Jura - still they - use the proportional system.\nThe National Council for its part has been elected to the proportional system since 1919. It is up to the cantons to play the role of electoral district.\nThis coexistence of a majority system and one of the proportions affects the weight of parties in Parliament. In the National Council, representation is determined by the percentage of votes obtained by each party. This percentage is generally used in the analysis of the results of an election and the progress or decline of a political camp.\nThe majority system for elections to the Council of States, on the other hand, does not necessarily promote the strongest party at the national level. Other considerations prevalent: the anchoring of the party within the canton, the ability to create alliances to present a single candidate, the predisposition to the consensus of that or the latter...\nIt is not a coincidence that the Council of States is still dominated by two historical parties, but only a little more than 26% of the vote in the last elections. The Centre and the Liberal-radical Party together have 25 representatives (13 for the first, 12 for the second) out of 46. The Democratic Union of the Centre (UDC), the country\u2019s first party with 25.6% of the vote, has only six seats.\nOn the contrary, the situation in the United States, for example, where the president can oppose certain laws, the Swiss Parliament is preserved from the other two powers. His decisions cannot be contested by the government. Nor can their constitutionality be challenged by the Federal Court, the highest judicial body in the country.\nConversely, the motion of censorship does not exist in Switzerland and the Federal Assembly does not have the opportunity to revoke the government or to dismiss one or more federal councillors during its term, except in exceptional cases as a serious illness.\nThe only opportunity for Parliament to demonstrate its possible discontent with a member of the executive comes with the election of the government every four years, in December following the federal elections. However, the system of consistency that characterizes Swiss policy makes it extremely rare. Since 1848, only four members of the federal government have not been confirmed by Parliament. The last one is the UDPC Christoph Blocher in 2007.\nNor does Switzerland know the antagonism between majority and opposition. In most cases, government and parliament must form a compromise that obtains the support of a majority, which may vary from case to case in the absence of a coalition agreement between the political forces. At the same time, parliamentarians from government parties have no obligation to support the decisions of the Federal Council.\nAll this is that Switzerland does not have a government crisis or early elections. The Legislature that Ends is 51\nsince 1848.\nIf his decisions are lawful, a heavy sword of Damocles constantly weighs on the Swiss Parliament. It responds to the name of an optional referendum. By means of the collection of 50'000 signatures within 100 days of the official publication, anyone can oppose a legislative decision by asking that the federal law or order be submitted to the electorate\u2019s verdict.\nBetween the founding of the federal state in 1848 and the introduction of the proportional system in 1917, the Federal Assembly was dominated by the Democratic Radical Party (now the Liberal-radical Party in 2009), with conservative Catholics (the future Democratic-Christian Party).\nThe introduction of the proportional system for election to the National Council in 1917 changed the deal. Until then, parties forced to settle the crumbs began to really weigh on national politics. In the same year, the Socialist Party increased from 22 to 41 representatives. During this election, the Parti des Peasants, artisans and independents, for its part, made a strong entrance to the House of the People. This formation, which became the centre\u2019s Democratic Union in 1971, now has a majority relative to the Swiss parliament.\nAlthough with ups and downs, these four parties made the rain and good weather in Switzerland throughout the 20th.\ncentury. At the end of the millennium, however, with the rise of ecological sensitivity, the Greens first, the Green Liberal Party then, rebranded the cards. Until one-fifth of the seats in the Federal Assembly in the last elections.\nThese 175 years of parliamentary history have of course known smaller, sometimes ephemeral or anchored parties only in some cantons. Parties that occasionally dictated the tempo on the files. This is the case of\nand his leader James Schwarzenbach. This far-right party, which has never had more than five seats, is at the origin of the popular initiative \u201cagainst the foreign grip\u201d of the early seventies.\nMore\n\n\n\n\n50 years ago in Switzerland, citizens rejected an initiative that would have led to the removal of hundreds of thousands of Italians.\nLess ephemeral,\nwas able to count on representatives to the National Council \u2013 and even to the Council of States \u2013 between 1935 and 1999. This movement, which was formed in 1935 by the founder of the Migros group, Gottlieb Duttweiler, targeted the whole power of lobbies in Parliament. At the end of the seventies, he obtained up to 10% of the vote, before a slow regression and then its dissolution in 1999.\nWe can also mention\n, which has never managed to penetrate in Switzerland, at least at the national level. forbidden in 1940, it will be replaced in 1944 by the\n. The\n, right-wing formation opposed to any State regulation in economic matters and environmental protection, appeared in 1985 to be renamed later Freedom Party.\nIs Confederation your daily bread? The term \"mile\" will probably evoke you some warlike image. Effectively derived from the military world, \"the concept of a militia system is a principle of organisation commonly practised in public life in Switzerland; it is based on the Republican idea that the citizen who has the capacity to carry out public duties and duties on an extra-professional and voluntary basis,\" as indicated in the\n.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland works a lot on the so-called militia system. But what exactly does that mean? Decryption.\nIn the Swiss political and institutional context, the militia system is seen as the opposite of \u201cprofessional\u201d. The Swiss Parliament is composed of politicians who engage in professional activity other than their parliamentary commitment. This is in any case the ideal vision that prevailed a few decades ago.\nNowadays, the work of federal parliamentarian-e has become more complex and equal to a mid-time job. Almost one in three is a full-time politician, according to one\nUniversity of Lausanne in 2019.\nUntil the end of the seventies, members of the Federal Assembly had no pay. Only presence tokens and travel allowances, on the contrary of their Western counterparts. Today, they receive an annual allowance of CHF 26,000, a daily allowance of CHF 440 per sitting day, a contribution of CHF 33,000 to cover the costs of personnel and equipment and various expenses for travel, meals and overnight stays.\nBetween 2011 and 2015, the median gross income amounted to 68,400 francs for the members of the National Council and 79,500 francs for those of the Council of States (who usually participate in more meetings of commissions and delegations), according to one\nUniversity of Geneva.\nThis income adds unspent lump-sum benefits, in particular the unspent share of staff costs. One or a member of the Federal Assembly is therefore likely to earn some 100,000 francs per year. More than the average national wage of just over 80,000 francs.\nWith regard to the wages of many of their European counterparts, however, Swiss parliamentarians are clearly underpaid. In Italy, for example, a country with a significantly lower cost of living than Switzerland, whose average income slightly exceeds 30'000 euros, members of the House and the Senate receive approximately 14'000 euros per month. In Brussels, MEPs receive a monthly salary of 9400 euros, not including various allowances.\nThis also means that in Switzerland, the profession of politician is certainly not the one who pays the best.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nIn Switzerland, one of the cheapest parliaments in the world is often mentioned. But do the Helvetic elect really win less than...\nAny Swiss citizen, man or woman, aged over 18, resident or not of Confederation, may be elected to Parliament. Most parliamentarians are members of a party. But this is not an obligation. Only persons protected as a result of a sustainable incapacity for discernment are excluded from eligibility by a general curator or a warrant for incapacity.\nDuring the current legislature, the National Council is composed of 41.5% women while the Council of States remains a male fief. Only one in four \"senator\" is female.\nAs far as the average age is concerned, it is 51 years in the People\u2019s Chamber and 57 years in the cantons. Figures remained almost stable since the beginning of 20\ncentury, however, with a slight rejuvenation to the National Council in the last thirty years.\nOverall, six out of ten elected members are in possession of an academic title, with strong variations from one party to another. The proportion reaches almost 90% in the Liberal Greens and descends to 33% in the UDC ranks, according to one\nof the University of Lausanne on the socio-professional profile of members of Parliament.\nWith regard to the profession, the profile of members of the Swiss Parliament, as often, does not exactly reflect that of society. In addition to the policy professionals, there is no surprise a high proportion of business chiefs, lawyers, farmers and farmers and teachers.\nFor example, lawyers represent some 0.3% of the working population while in Parliament, they and they occupy one in ten seats. Even for women farmers and farmers: their weight in the legislative body largely exceeds the 2% observed in the population.\nMore\n\nIn comparison to other countries, Switzerland is distinguished by its legendary stability.

G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, le discours entendu est de dire que ces \u00e9lections n\u2019apportent gu\u00e8re de changements.",

J\u2019en ai donc conclu qu\u2019au pays de la d\u00e9mocratie directe, ce n'est pas le r\u00e9sultat \u00e0 des \u00e9lections qui est d\u00e9terminant pour l\u2019\u00e9lectorat.",

Mais ces textes pourraient \u00eatre aussi combattus par r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum. En conclusion, cela signifie que le parti vainqueur d\u2019une \u00e9lection peut subir une d\u00e9faite cuisante \u00e0 tout moment.",

Ceci alors que le taux de natalit\u00e9 continue de baisser. Ce cercle est vicieux.",
                    "La d\u00e9mocratie en Suisse est pour sa part encore pr\u00e9serv\u00e9e de ce genre de d\u00e9rive. Lors de cette campagne \u00e9lectorale, le parti socialiste (gauche) veut certes d\u00e9velopper les structures d\u2019accueil publiques pour la garde des enfants tandis que le parti le plus fort en termes d\u2019\u00e9lus \u00e0 Berne, l'Union d\u00e9mocratique du centre (UDC), d\u2019ob\u00e9dience conservatrice, s'y oppose.",
                    "Mais g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, la question de la politique familiale ne figure pas parmi les pr\u00e9occupations de l\u2019\u00e9lectorat. D\u2019apr\u00e8s des sondages, la hausse des primes des caisses-maladie, l\u2019immigration et la r\u00e9forme des retraites sont autrement plus pl\u00e9biscit\u00e9es par la population. \u00a0\u00a0",

Le taux de natalit\u00e9 en berne n'est-il pas pris en compte alors que le pays suscite la convoitise de personnes migrantes qui r\u00eavent de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de meilleurs salaires, d\u2019une meilleure qualit\u00e9 de vie et d\u2019un climat politique et \u00e9conomique apais\u00e9? N\u2019est-il pas important d'envoyer au parlement des \u00e9lus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9coute des jeunes, a fortiori dans un pays o\u00f9 la plupart des objets finissent en vote? Autant de questions ouvertes.",
                    "Dans ces conditions, j\u2019ai le sentiment que la Suisse court le risque de devenir \u00e0 terme \u00e9galement un peu comme le Japon\u2026 \u00abune d\u00e9mocratie vieillissante\u00bb. Certes, d\u00e9mographiquement, selon les statistiques de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2022, la part des seniors est moins importante dans la population suisse (19,2%) qu\u2019elle l\u2019est au Japon, o\u00f9 le taux est de 29,1%.",
                    "Mais il convient cependant de relever que 26% des adultes de plus de 18 ans domicili\u00e9s en Suisse sont des personnes \u00e9trang\u00e8res qui n\u2019ont tout simplement pas le droit de voter. En d\u2019autres termes, le vieillissement de l'\u00e9lectorat suisse est plus net qu\u2019il n\u2019y para\u00eet de prime abord, s'\u00e9levant en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 \u00e0 23,1%. Soit le taux du Japon en 2010!",
                    "Je pose donc la question: la Suisse pourra-t-elle \u00e9viter de sombrer dans une d\u00e9mocratie de ce type? Ou deviendra-t-elle un mod\u00e8le pour des pays occidentaux \u00e0 la population de plus en plus vieillissante?",

Mon pays d\u2019origine n\u2019en \u00e9tait certes pas \u00e0 son premier scrutin, mais un premier vote libre, d\u00e9mocratique et transparent oui.",
                    "J\u2019avais tremp\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 avec un immense plaisir mon doigt dans l'encre bleue pour valider mon bulletin, partageant cette exp\u00e9rience sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux. Ce fut une f\u00eate et l\u2019accomplissement d\u2019un droit politique.",
                    "En contribuant avec mon bulletin \u00e0 la d\u00e9mocratisation de mon pays, j\u2019avais ressenti le poids historique de cet instant pour les g\u00e9n\u00e9rations d\u2019avant et pour la mienne.

                "en_content": "Journalists of about 15 different origins are working together in the swissinfo.ch editor in Bern, looking at events in Switzerland, where these journalists have been living for decades, while also looking at the news in their country of childhood.\nOriginally from Japan, the United States, Tunisia, Russia, China or Mexico, six collaborators and collaborators report what they see makes this election exciting.\nEvery four years, Switzerland renews its parliament in elections often without history that do not bury the country\u2019s stability. Without big upheavals, few media are interested in it elsewhere in Switzerland. Does this vote deserve to be held there? Their answers.\n\u201cThe instruments of direct democracy deprive us of power, we parliamentarians, knowing that here it is the people who have the last word. In Switzerland, power has been sprayed.\" This is how a Swiss MP, me and two other Mexican journalists responded to the question of how the political system worked in his country.\nAchieving good results in a federal election in Switzerland does not mean that the electorate will, for example, give unrestricted confidence to parties that sit on the government.\nThe people can always assert their veto power over legislative decisions through initiatives and referendums. This allows it to express itself in order not only to question parliamentary decisions, but also to propose amendments in the Federal Constitution.\nI'm from Mexico. 25 years ago, while I was looking for collaborations to become a correspondent in Switzerland, Mexican publishers told me that \u201cthe policy was boring in Switzerland\u201d.\nIt is above all a matter of perspective. Since the elections in Switzerland are not limited to a struggle between two or three protagonists, it is precisely one of the reasons that makes this system interesting for analysis. A system also where the president or president of Confederation is of little importance unlike Mexico.\nFollowing the October 22 elections, the Swiss Parliament will elect the government, a college composed of seven members from the most dominant parties. The weight of power is distributed on several shoulders and forces in presence according to the consensus in Switzerland.\nThat is the reason why the names of government members are missing from some of the population. Same for the president or president of the country, a representative post that echoes each year to one of the seven Sages according to an oiled tournus.\nThis form of shared power thus proves that another system is possible. Other in any case than that in Mexico, where politics always looks more like one\na TV show.\nIn Switzerland, a small country filled with modesty, the prevalent idea is that democracy in Switzerland is such a complicated process that it is practically vain to explain it to foreign people. What is paradoxical knowing that Switzerland is located in the heart of Europe, a leader on the front of globalization, with a leading financial and banking role and where a large number of international organizations have set up their headquarters. A country that also houses a strong military-industrial complex.\nYet, every four years, the legislative elections that take place are almost indifferenced abroad, where the names of Swiss politicians and politicians do not say anything to anyone.\nLet us try to explain how traditional tools (elections) specific to any representative democracy coexist here with tools of direct democracy. Generally, the speech heard is to say that these elections do not bring much change.\nThe things in my opinion do not change every four years in Switzerland, but every day because of the voting that takes place there regularly at all levels, federal, cantonal or communal. I have therefore concluded that in the country of direct democracy, it is not the result of elections that is crucial to the electorate.\nIt is more about how parties work throughout the year in the imbroglio of the federalist system that they are judged in these elections. That their actions take place at the municipal, cantonal or federal level. With the right of popular initiative and the referendum, a victory in the elections actually offers no guarantee of having a white card for four years.\nAfter this election, the most prominent political parties will be required to sketch solutions through laws and initiatives to respond to contemporary challenges. But these texts could also be fought by referendum. In conclusion, this means that the winning party of an election can be defeated at any time.\nThe expression of \"aging democracy\" has flourished in Japan, confronted with the ageing of its population and a low rate of participation of young people in the elections. \u201cA senior policy made by seniors for seniors\u201d has been established. This allows older parliamentarians and traditional parties to regularly glean implementation to implement their policy.\nReforms to reduce spending for seniors are postponed. But at the same time, taxes and insurance premiums are increasing for younger generations who have no prospect of future. This while the birth rate continues to decline. This circle is vicious.\nFor its part, democracy in Switzerland is still preserved from this kind of drift. During this election campaign, the socialist party (left) wants to develop public reception structures for the custody of children, while the strongest party in terms of emoluments in Bern, the Democratic Union of the Centre (UDC), of conservative obedience, opposes it.\nBut generally, the issue of family policy is not among the concerns of the electorate. Based on polls, the rise in cash premiums, immigration and pension reform are otherwise more popular.\nWhat would then explain this low interest in family policy in Switzerland? Is the rate of birth in berne not taken into account when the country is a source of the desire of migrant people who dream of benefiting from better wages, better quality of life and a peaceful political and economic climate? Is it not important to send elected officials to parliament to listen to young people, a fortiori in a country where most objects end in voting? So many open questions.\nIn these circumstances, I have the feeling that Switzerland is running the risk of becoming a bit like Japan as well... \u201caging democracy\u201d. Indeed, demographically, according to the statistics of 2022, the share of seniors is less important in the Swiss population (19.2%) than it is in Japan, where the rate is 29.1%.\nHowever, it should be noted that 26% of adults over the age of 18 in Switzerland are foreign people who simply do not have the right to vote. In other words, the ageing of the Swiss electorate is more net than it seems to be first and foremost, in reality, at 23.1%. Either the rate of Japan in 2010!\nI therefore ask the question: Can Switzerland avoid falling into such a democracy? Or will it become a model for Western countries to the growing population?\nIt is with nostalgia that I think today at my first participation, at the age of 22, in legislative elections in Tunisia. My country of origin was certainly not in its first ballot, but a first free, democratic and transparent vote yes.\nI had soaked at that moment with immense pleasure my finger in blue ink to validate my newsletter, sharing this experience on social networks. It was a celebration and the fulfilment of a political right.\nBy contributing with my newsletter to the democratization of my country, I had felt the historical weight of this moment for the generations before and for mine. As I now live in Switzerland, he goes without saying that I would absolutely like to participate in his democratic process.\nBut for a quarter of the Swiss population of voting age, of which I am part, it is forbidden to slip its ballot in the ballot box for this ballot.\nThe approximately 2.3 million people of foreign origin established in the country did not receive any envelopes with voting equipment. In order to be able to vote in national elections or elections, you must be Switzerland or Switzerland. Some wonder why we should be interested in this election abroad.\nAs a foreign journalist working in Switzerland, this issue for me goes beyond the simple framework of national borders. Because the outcome of this election may have a certain impact on people and families from immigration, regardless of where they are today.\nThe orientation that will be taken by the Swiss Parliament after this election can also have an influence on their future, or even decide on the fate of thousands of people in connection with the migration issue and international cooperation, an area in which Switzerland continues to excel. This is not just a matter of domestic policy, but of the impact that this political orientation could have on the lives of thousands of people abroad as well.\nAlthough I cannot vote, I will follow this election with attention and circumspection. And like those excluded from this election, I will maintain the flame of being able to participate one day in this democratic dance.\nFirst observation: in Switzerland, political parties play a much different role than we know in China.\nIn the preamble to the Chinese Constitution, the Communist Party of the People &apos; s Republic of China is already much more prominent than the \u201cAlmighty God\u201d mentioned in the preamble to the Swiss fundamental charter.\nAnother difference is that, while article 1 of the Swiss Constitution lists the 26 constituent cantons of Confederation, the Confederation specifies in China that the socialist system is the foundation of the People's Republic. And that his leadership by the Communist Party (PCC) is the mark of Chinese socialism.\nWhile the CCP Secretary General\u2019s position is the core of power in China, the march of the party presidency is mainly dependent in Switzerland on their ability to convince the electorate in elections.\nThe legal status of these political formations is low. Since 1999, a brief article, number 137, has been enshrined in the Constitution. It is succinctly said that \u201cpolitical parties contribute to form popular opinion and will\u201d. There is no mention of a relationship between the state and a political party in particular, since there is a multitude of them. Only in parliament, eleven are represented and four are currently sitting on the Federal Council, the equivalent of the central government.\nThe Swiss political landscape is also constantly changing. The parties go and come. Some merge or change their name. Finally, others are solid like rock. It is always that these trainings must constantly be profiled according to the themes of the moment in an unbridled race to concepts to win votes. They must convince the electorate by proposing remedies against the evils of society. But at the end, it is the electorate who decides because he can manifest his discontent with a party on the occasion of elections.\nSwitzerland and the United States, which I am a native, share many common points. A first pride of living in democracies where the right to vote is deeply entrenched. But a polarization of political life is also becoming increasingly common.\nA few years ago, the New Yorker magazine wrote that \u201cno forum seemed too small or asleep to be polarized\u201d. But for about ten years, the mentality of \u201cwe against them\u201d has been imposed in the United States. This manicidism is a threat to the country and invites itself in all areas of everyday life.\nThis polarization shakes the Capitol in Washington as well as family dinners. Switzerland, where the search for consensus prevailed, seemed to be spared by this phenomenon given the presence of much more than two major parties as in the United States. The country has six of them that are the lion\u2019s share, as well as a dozen smaller formations. These parties are fighting the seats of Parliament.\nBut signals also show that in Switzerland a growing polarization is at work, forming part of the political landscape. A recent survey of the population revealed in it a fear of a fragmentation of society in a multitude of small groups that could oppose to becoming irreconcilable. \u201cToday everything is rather black or white,\u201d a Swiss friend told me.\nFor analysts, the Covid was a turning point, creating a new net demarcation line between different population groups.\nIf discussing matters of substance and law with the balance of different points of view is normal in a democratic society, the creeping polarization is of emotional essence. It is manifested in particular by an increasingly screaming intolerance towards those who would think otherwise today. It seems to me that we judge for example more abhorrently now than yesterday others according to their opinions. But I also note that themes are more emotionally charged in the United States, such as abortion.\nIf in Switzerland the polarization has not reached the extremes it knows in the United States, the subject nevertheless taraudes in a country where parties are numerous and where trust in institutions is high.\nThis drift ultimately does not help democracies by leading groups to no longer talk, remaining locked in their echo chamber. With the corollary a debate that arose between protagonists in a society where new ideas had trouble perceiving.\nDisillusionment could also force in the electoral body in the face of a more inclined political class to dig deeper differences than to find solutions. Crossed among clans, the population could be tempted to seek answers elsewhere than in the political serail.\nOn the eve of these federal elections, the question is how Switzerland will be able to manage this rampant polarization and what message can it deliver to the United States and other democracies on the subject.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe electoral campaigns in Switzerland are not as boring as we usually think about it abroad, says historian Zo\u00e9 Kergomard.\nMore\n\nIn comparison to other countries, Switzerland is distinguished by its legendary stability. How does she explain?\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

There are many international organizations in Geneva that deal with these themes. The United Nations Human Rights Office is headed by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, a post held since 17 October 2022 by the Austrian Volker T\u00fcrk. He replaces Chilean Michelle Bachelet. The new head of human rights must face multiple challenges, including a United Nations divided on war in Ukraine, many crises around the world and the puzzle to determine how to deal with China.\nShortly before midnight, August 31, 2022, in the last minutes of her term, Michelle Bachelet published a report as expected and controversial on the Chinese province of Xinjiang. It refers to possible crimes against humanity committed against the Uyghur Muslim minority. Its publication prompted Western countries and NGOs to ask for a debate on Xinjiang during the autumn session 2022 of the Human Rights Council (CHRC), but this request was rejected, reflecting the divisions within the United Nations and the pressure on some members of the Human Rights Council.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nDespite the efforts of Western countries and NGOs, the UN human rights body refused to address the Xinjiang.\nAt the same session, however, the Commission adopted a resolution to appoint a special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Russia. La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La\non the human rights violations in Ukraine, established by the CDH in the spring of 2022, presented its interim report and stated that, on the basis of the evidence gathered so far, \u201cwar crimes have been committed\u201d.\nThe Human Rights Council is located in the heart of international Geneva, with its headquarters at the Palais des Nations, the United Nations European headquarters. The United Nations General Assembly in New York voted on 7 April on the suspension of Russia of that body due to the war in Ukraine. It is only the second time in history that a country is suspended, after the Libya of Muammar Kadhafi. But the vote was rather ambivalent, according to an analysis by SWI swissinfo.ch.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe supporters and results of the suspension of Russia of the Human Rights Council.\nTo understand the functioning and activities of the Human Rights Council, watch this explanatory video:\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Rights Council is the principal organ of the United Nations to promote and protect human rights.\nWith the humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, other United Nations agencies such as UNHCR, the refugee agency based in Geneva, and the World Food Programme (WFP) have a great deal to do to help. The conflict has caused a food crisis in some parts of the world, particularly in Africa and the Middle East. Supply is interrupted, prices increase and aid agencies are overflowed.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe war disrupts the global supply of food, fuel and fertilizer, and the hard impact of millions of people in Africa.\nA flagship agreement, concluded in July 2022 under the aegis of the United Nations and Turkey, however, allowed Ukraine, a major grain producer, to resume its exports to the Black Sea. The price of cereals in the international markets has thus been reduced to a decline, slowing the rise of hunger in the world. Despite Moscow\u2019s threats to withdraw, the agreement \u2013 by which the United Nations is also committed to facilitating Russian fertilizer exports \u2013 was extended in November 2022 for another four months.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nAn agreement authorizing the exports of Ukrainian cereals has been extended despite Moscow\u2019s threats to withdraw.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the custodian of the Geneva Conventions and probably the most famous of the many international NGOs based in Geneva, was also put under pressure by the war in Ukraine. The ICRC continues to defend its neutrality in order to be able to speak to all parties of a conflict and save lives, but it must face numerous criticisms, especially from the Ukrainian authorities. The latter blame him for not visiting the prisoners of war held by Russia. Under international law, States are required to provide ICRC with regular access to prisoners of war, but it still does not have full access, particularly in the regions of Ukraine controlled by Russia.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nUkrainian families of prisoners of war in Geneva to request more action from international bodies.\nBecause of climate change and wars that are sneezing, the United Nations expects humanitarian needs to explode in 2023. However, the gap between humanitarian needs and harvested funds continues to increase and undermines the capacity of the United Nations system to respond to unprecedented crises. The war in Ukraine is one of the factors that fuel this underfunding, but not the only.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe UN Refugee Agency faces an unprecedented funding gap. A widespread humanitarian situation.\nBut if the eyes are now turned on Ukraine, the Covid-19 pandemic is not over. And even if the world learns to live with this virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) wants to learn from it.\nAt a special session in December 2021, WHO member States committed themselves to conducting negotiations for a future global pandemic treaty. It should enable the international community to better respond to future health crises, but it will probably not be ready until at least 2024.\nWHO is a United Nations specialized agency based in Geneva. It was founded in 1948 to promote universal access to care, set standards and coordinate the global response to health crises.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nWhat do we really know about the World Health Organization, the agency that the Covid-19 propelled under the spotlight?\nThe WTO also found itself in the eye of the cyclone during the pandemic. The delicate issue of vaccine access inequalities was discussed in June 2022, during a\nGeneva. A temporary lifting of patents on coronavirus vaccines was decided.\nThe WTO has 164 member countries and has a long history.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nReturn to image on the multilateral history of trade agreements, from GATT to WTO.\nIn recent years, the international Geneva agencies have been complemented by teams of investigation and international justice specialists to collect and preserve evidence in order to prepare possible future trials for serious international crimes committed in Ukraine and elsewhere.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland has established a working group to collect evidence of possible war crimes in Ukraine from refugees.\nEven if the crimes committed in the field against the civilian population are at the centre of these efforts, the attacks carried out online are also in the Geneva NGO target.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe harm caused by cyber attacks in Ukraine is pale in comparison with atrocities on the ground. But the civilians are not spared.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "en_content": "More than 120,000 work places were vacant in Switzerland at the end of 2022, a number never seen since 2003 - the year of the oldest figures provided by the Federal Statistical Office (FSB). This phenomenon does not only affect Confederation: three out of four companies worldwide report recruitment difficulties, according to the ManpowerGroup recruitment giant.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nWith more than 100,000 vacancies registered in the first quarter of 2022, labour shortages have reached records in Switzerland.\nHotel-restauration, industry, IT, construction, health, logistics: the list of professions that desperately seek staff is as long as varied. \"All economic sectors are now competing to attract the same type of skills. If you\u2019re an IT specialist or a book driver, you\u2019ll be spoiled for choice in your job search,\u201d says Stefan Studer, director of the Swiss Employees Association.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nRestoration, industry, nursing and personal care, IT: the most sought-after professions in Switzerland.\nThe strong post-pandemic economic recovery partly explains these recruitment challenges. In some areas of activity, in particular hotel-restauration and care, the pandemic also highlighted difficult working conditions, pushing many employees to reorient themselves to other occupations.\nHowever, the current situation could only be a pre-examination of the difficulties faced by Swiss employers in their quest for staff in the future. Because of the ageing population and the retirement of the so-called \"baby-boomers\" generation, the labour market is expected to face major upheavals in the coming years.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nPopulation aging and changes in lifestyles transform the labour market, both in Switzerland and in other developed countries.\nWith a lower unemployment rate for 20 years, a high demand for labour and the total lifting of health restrictions, it is no wonder that immigration is going up again in Switzerland. \"Switzerland is one of the most attractive countries in Europe for migrant people in search of work,\" said Philippe Wanner, professor at the Institute of Demography and Socio-Economics at the University of Geneva. And these people know success in this demanding labour market, but which offers higher wages in European comparison.\"\nMore\n\n\n\n\nWith a lower unemployment rate, immigration is rising in Switzerland. The neighbouring countries provide the bulk of the imported labour force.\nActive people from the European Union (EU) and EFTA have easy access to the Swiss labour market. They benefit from the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons (ALCP). However, competition is becoming more and more difficult to attract skilled labour from other European countries.\nThis is particularly the case in the field of health: Swiss hospitals carry out active recruitment campaigns abroad to cope with the shortage of \u201cwhite coats\u201d. \u201cBut even in Poland, it is difficult to find enough qualified staff ready to settle in Switzerland,\u201d says Grazyna Scheiwiller of Carenea, a company specializing in labour recruitment in Poland.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe shortage of qualified personnel requires hospitals to look for trained personnel abroad.\nFor non-European job seekers, access to the Swiss labour market remains restricted. Only highly skilled workers in so-called third countries (i.e. outside Europe) are admitted. Employers who wish to engage in labour from these countries must prove that they have not found anyone with the corresponding qualification either in Switzerland or within the EU/EFTA space. In addition, this type of admissions must be in the interest of Switzerland and the economy. The number of work permits for persons from third countries is also limited by quotas.\n\n\n\n\nObtaining a work permit in Switzerland depends on many factors, including origin and skills.\nDespite the record vacancy rate, the question of whether immigrants and immigrants take jobs at the national level remains politically controversial. The impact of immigration on infrastructure and the environment is also regularly criticized by a part of the political class. The conservative right was one of its main campaign themes for the October 22 federal elections.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe rapid growth of the population in Switzerland, due to high immigration, becomes one of the flagship themes of the upcoming federal elections.\nDue to the crispness of the immigration issue, other solutions are put forward to try to overcome this shortage. Economic circles want to prioritize the potential of the native workforce. First of all, women, who are close to six out of ten in part-time employment \u2013 a virtually high rate in Europe.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe lack of qualified staff has become the main concern of Swiss employers. Monica Dell'Anna sketches solutions.\nThere are also other communities in the population: youth, the elderly, and the beneficiaries of social assistance. The Conference of Social Action Institutions (CSIAS) and the Swiss Federation for Continuing Training (FSEA) have recently launched a training offensive for social assistance recipients, while the priority has so far been on vocational reintegration. \u201cExperience shows that improving skills makes integration into the labour market more sustainable. It\u2019s a paradigm shift in the field,\u201d said FSEA President Matthias Aebischer.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nInstitutions active in social assistance want to encourage reintegration into the labour market by focusing on continuous training.\nRefugee resources could also be more mobilized to cope with the shortage of personnel. The Confederation and the cantons believe that about 70% of them could be permanently integrated into the labour market.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nMany refugees do not find employment in Switzerland. The lack of knowledge of their rights and ideas received does not play in their favour.\nLa raret\u00e9 de la main-d\u2019oeuvre est \u00e9galement une aubaine pour toutes les personnes d\u00e9j\u00e0 sous contrat avec une entreprise. They now hold the knife in the round during the wage negotiations. With a report of force in favour of employees and their representatives, collective claims could gain in importance in the future.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nLack of labour could play in favour of trade unions and staff during the fall wage negotiations. Maintenance.\nThis new product also creates an increasingly important thirst for professional mobility, especially in the younger generation. While the magnitude of this trend does not yet reach the phenomenon of the \u201cGreat Remission\u201d observed in the United States or the United Kingdom, companies are nevertheless forced to operate 180-degree organizational and cultural corners to seduce and retain young talent.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of labour shortages, young talents take advantage of their strong position in the face of businesses.\nMore\nDiscussion\nLike many other countries, Switzerland faces a significant shortage of skilled labour. Nearly 100,000 workstations were...\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

Swiss ministers travel almost always without special protection.\nConfidence in the government is higher in Switzerland than in any other OECD country. According to a study by the Zurich Federal Polytechnic School (EPFZ) entitled \u201c\n\"This level of confidence has even slightly increased during the pandemic. At the same time, Switzerland is one of the most stable countries in the world, both politically and economically. Stability is a confidence factor in institutions.\nIn recent years, democracy has declined around the world \u2013 and States like Brazil and the United States have even experienced attempts at coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. Many democracies struggle to maintain themselves. Switzerland is stable for its part: from left to right, large parties continue to govern together.\nConfidence is a factor of social stability. Since the creation of the federal state in 1848, only a handful of ministers had to leave against their will. At the Federal Council, seven heads the country\u2019s seven departments (departments) \u2013 up to now 111 men and 10 women. In Italy, no less than 1,300 ministers have been sworn in since 1946.\nThe University of Bern concludes that the high confidence in the Swiss government, which has increased in the past 20 years, is one of the reasons for this continuity.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nFew governments benefit from such great confidence from the population as the Federal Council. What are the ingredients?\nIn Switzerland, as in other developed democracies, the executive branch, the legislative branch and the judiciary control each other \u2013 but the Swiss authorities must increasingly submit to popular vote. And sometimes, the people, the supreme sovereign in Swiss political design, can refuse the objects presented to them.\nThe Swiss militia system entrusts responsibility to the population. Anyone who wants to move things is engaged in an association, participates in a demonstration - or works as a deputy returning officer or deputy returning officer during the many votes.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nRouages de la d\u00e9mocratie, deux scruteurs tell what motivates them to engage in elections and voting.\nParticipation opportunities create confidence.\nConfidence in the government, the economy and the courts is great in Switzerland. But it is the police that enjoys the greatest confidence: in the annual study of the EPFZ on security, the police regularly arrive at the top of the confidence classification. In spite of the criticisms it has been subjected to, in particular with regard to the proportionality of interventions during political demonstrations or accusations of racial profiling.\nAlready during their training, members of the security forces are training in behaviour that creates confidence. \u201cWe can carry out a road check in different ways,\u201d says Fabia Freienmuth of the Swiss Eastern Police School. I can go, cross the arms and say, 'Hello, well, what have we done again wrong today? It is also possible to proceed otherwise, so as to reduce the tension instead of further causing the other.\u201d This creates a positive experience that will serve as a basis for the next contact with the police.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nAt the training centre of the police school in Eastern Switzerland, the behaviour to be adopted when a situation threatens to degenerate.\nSwitzerland is a rule of law that works, with extensive individual freedoms: the political system provides means to avoid a too high concentration of power in the hands of individuals or parties. In Switzerland, the population can defend itself against the arbitrariness. The freedom of research and the press is protected. But there are exceptions, for example in the Banking Act.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe media and the world of historical research demand a softening of the law on bank secrecy.\nProsperity also contributes to this comparatively high confidence: the vast majority of people living in Switzerland live in economic security. However, almost 15% of the population is poor or threatened with poverty. This population is particularly affected by rising prices of food, energy and consumer goods.\nBut if prices have increased less in Switzerland than in neighbouring countries last year, it is also thanks to the Swiss franc that has remained surprisingly stable in the face of inflation.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe Swiss franc also owes its reputation as a stable currency to a policy that has often shifted stability before export interests.\nBut Swiss life, comfortable for many people, has also always been critical: can we be gifted in the arts if there are so few unexpected things?\n19\ncentury already, Carl Spitteler, the only Nobel Prize in Swiss literature, played with the idea of blowing the Alps. Since then, the lamentations on the stability of the country come back to every generation.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nLamentations on boredom in Switzerland last for generations. Would the country be too narrow for great art?\nHowever, Swiss history is not always a long, quiet river. At regular intervals, events fear the end of this eternal stability. Some examples: the general strike of 1918, the scandal of the fact sheets in 1990, the collapse of the Swissair airline in 2001 or the difficulties of the Swiss banking giants.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland is known for its legendary stability, but its recent history has not always been a long, quiet river.\nIn 2023, Switzerland celebrates 175\nanniversary of its Federal Constitution. But in parallel with these celebrations, a popular initiative calls for a complete revision of the Constitution. Indeed, this is far from perfect.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe third episode of our series \"The Homes of Swiss Democracy\" in Bern, the birthplace of the modern Swiss Federal State.\nIn Switzerland too, institutions struggle for their legitimacy and the former authorities must actively strive to gain people\u2019s confidence. Social networks change the speech. The populist eruptions have often been integrated into Switzerland. But they continue to pose a challenge to the country.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSocial networks are used throughout the world, but this does not mean that they have the same impact in all points of the world.\nSwitzerland faces the same challenge as all democracies: how can the population develop and maintain social cohesion? The situation of departure is not so bad to achieve it.\nMore\nDiscussion\nConfidence in justice, politics, police and the media is one of the foundations for the proper functioning of democracies.

During the traditional TV debate at the end of the day, President Marco Chiesa nevertheless wanted to be modest: \u201cWe have received a clear mandate from the people to put on the table important themes such as illegal immigration and its consequences and safe energy supply. In this sense, we get a very good result, but these are only forecasts.\"\nThe second highest score behind the UDPC, the Socialist Party (PS) said it was satisfied with the results, especially in Romandie, where \u201cthey are pretty impressive,\u201d according to its co-chair C\u00e9dric Wermuth. The PS progresses slightly for the first eight years at the national level and wins 1 seat, according to the latest SSR projection. \u201cIt is clear that the people gave us the mandate to be the counterweight of the UDC,\u201d he added.\nThe presidents of the ecologist parties expressed their obvious disappointment, as their scores are sharply declining. \u201cWe still hold two-thirds of our seats under the dome, while the UDC recovered only two-thirds of the seats it lost in 2019,\u201d said Balthasar Gl\u00e4ttli, President of the Greens. The party loses 6 seats on the National Council and passes under 10% of the vote. As for the Greens, they lose 5 chairs.\nWhile 2019 had experienced an unprecedented green wave, 2023 praised the hopes of many and many environmental candidates.

These subjects have obviously been fly to the electorate.\nWith the new composition of Parliament, the economic journal\nfears a lack of pragmatism. Responding by reassuring but simplistic speeches to the public\u2019s concerns about real problems \u2013 such as those caused by immigration \u2013 can certainly help to be elected, remarks\n. Before adding that the work of a parliamentarian then consists in responding to the challenges facing Switzerland.\nFor the president of the Liberal-radical Party (PLR) Thierry Burkart, the theme of asylum gained importance during the campaign. \u201cIf we do not want the UDPC to gain even more land in four years, we must take this matter seriously,\u201d he warned. The liberal right-wing party gets 14.6% of the vote and thus loses 0.5 percentage points.\nThe increase in health costs, including health insurance premiums, was one of the other major topics in the campaign.\nIn this area, the PS \u201cdoes not wait for the support of the right-wing parties\u201d and will launch a new initiative for a single case of illness\u201d. But C\u00e9dric Wermuth has nuanced his remarks and added that to find solutions, \"discussions with all parties are always possible\".\nA view shared by Gerhard Pfister, president of the Centre. According to him, the Swiss people see their party and the PS as the most competent in the field of health. \u201cOur goal is that costs no longer increase. To do this, we will create alliances with parties that share part of our ideas\".\nBeyond this particular theme, party presidents seemed inclined to promote the culture of compromise. \"We need to find solutions that bring together,\" said Michel Matter, Vice President of the Greens, for whom the ecological transition and the ageing of the population must become the priorities of Parliament. And Balthasar Gl\u00e4ttli adds: \u201cWe need to find ways to protect the climate even in this more difficult environment, because the climate does not wait\u201d.\nThe daily\nMoreover, it considers that the good results of the UDC will oblige it to take its responsibilities and to stop being only an opposition party that blows on the braises and refuses to create genuine constructive alliances.\nWhile the Centre is at the elbow with the PLR to become the third political force in the country, the issue of the composition of the Federal Council was again raised. The latter has two seats for the UDC, two for the PS, two for the PLR and one for the Centre.\nIf Gerhard Pfister considers that the distribution of seats in the Federal Council should be discussed in depth to see if the Federal Council is still justified, the issue of the resumption by Le Centre of one of the PLR seats is not relevant in the current context. \u201cIf the results confirm, only the UDC has two seats,\u201d he added. The PLR said it was relieved not to expect a question of its two seats.\nMichel Matter is of the opinion that \u201cthe distribution of seats on the Federal Council is deduced\u201d. But, as St\u00e9phane Deleury, head of political line at RTS radio, said, in order to change the composition of the government, a party must be politically and win votes without alliance.

According to the ABS study, out of 4106 articles analysed for eight weeks, the UDC is the most often mentioned party, as shown in the chart below. Follow the PS, the PLR, the Centre, the Green-e-s and the Green-e-liberals.\nThese proportions reflect the strength of the parties after the 2019 elections. However, the four government parties are slightly overrepresented compared to the other parties. What plays in the deflection of the Green-e-s and the Green-liberals. \"It is amazing to see how much the print media as a whole can reflect the dominant relations in terms of electoral force,\" says B\u00fchlmann.\n\"It would be too simple to conclude that a party wins because we speak a lot of it,\" the political expert warned. However, it recognizes that being present in the media undeniably allows to mobilize. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we talk about you. Whether this media coverage is positive or negative doesn't matter,\" explains the latter.\nThis illustrates the responsibility of journalists. \u201cThe media are still questioning to determine the extent to which they must report the provocations during the electoral campaign,\u201d notes Marc B\u00fchlmann. The political scientist recalls that, in the 1990s and 2000, the provocations of the UDC have always been reported. \"The media then had to see that it allowed the party to attract even more attention,\" he said.\nThe analysis of the media coverage of the 2023 election campaign also shows that no theme has been able to truly impose itself against others. A wide range of topics has been addressed, says the ABS: the terms \"health and health\" have certainly appeared most often, but banking policy, transport, energy, migration and climate have also been themes in the articles.\nWhile migration policy had been at the centre of the debates in the 2015 elections and climate policy in 2019, in 2023 it was not possible to speak of \"an essentially monothematic media coverage of the electoral campaign,\" said Marc B\u00fchlmann.\nThe UDPC has benefited from the media attention to migration, its predilection theme, particularly because of a new rise in asylum applications in Switzerland. On the other hand, environmentalists have not managed to use the theme of global warming to their advantage. The articles on climate policy, for example, on activists who stick to a road and block traffic, have instead affected them.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nHere are the main lessons to be learned from this election Sunday.

All results of federal elections in detail.\nAnke Tresch: This is a shift to the right from the 2019 elections. But perhaps less if we look further in time: between 2015 and 2019, the UDC had lost twelve seats. Today she won nine; So she did not regain the same strength as in 2015.\nIn addition, if we count all the voices of the whole right, i.e. the UDC, the Liberal-radical Party (PLR) and smaller formations, we see that it has lost its absolute majority to the National Council. These parties reached a total of 101 seats out of 200, which will not be the case for the new legislature.\nBut on the whole, the right was significantly stronger than the last legislature: in the Canton of Geneva, the right-wing populist movement of the Geneva Citizen Movement (MCG) made a very good score by winning two seats. Lega was able to stay in Ticino, and the Federal Democratic Union (UDF) also won a seat.\nYes, it certainly is. The Green-e-s lost less seats than could have been assumed on the basis of percentages. But there was no transfer of voice between the Greens and the PS: the ecologists lost five seats and the socialists won two seats; So there's something missing. In addition, the left-wing parties lost the two seats they had obtained during the last legislature. In the end, the camp of the left has weakened.\nIt is difficult to quantify. But in principle, in times of global crisis \u2013 when themes such as war, security, immigration and asylum are gaining importance \u2013 the nervousness and the need for security are increasing, also in Switzerland.\nAnd this traditionally reinforces the right-wing forces, in the first place of course the UDC, which has clearly positioned itself on these themes for years. It is felt that this time, the UDPC was better able to mobilize than in the 2019 elections, where many of its electives and voters had stayed home in the context of the climate theme. They were motivated to return to the ballot box in a context that corresponds more to their own concerns and their favourite themes.\nYes, this trend exists, at least in Europe, such as Germany, where several regional elections have taken place in recent weeks. Both AfD and CDU have made progress. Of course, the momentum is different, because with the system of government and opposition, government parties are willingly sanctioned, regardless of the ruling party. But fundamentally, one can recognize a tendency: the strengthening of conservative forces.\nThe analysis of the political scientist Pascal Sciarini in the T\u00e9l\u00e9journal de la RTS on 23 October 2023\nIt is indeed the impression that personalities are no longer as important as that. With Marco Chiesa, the party has a rather erased president, which did not prevent him from advancing strongly. The UDC is now more diversified, it is no longer dependent on a single person, but several heads have successfully managed this election campaign.\nThe party has highlighted its favourite themes, which have found an echo in the context of this foreign policy situation. Nevertheless, in the background, Christoph Blocher continues of course to play a role as a funder.\nIt was one of the very interesting issues before these elections. It was not clear whether one could simply add the electoral shares of the bourgeois Democratic Party (PBD) and the Democratic Party (PDC) to the final result of the Centre. But it worked well: name change and mergers really seem to have been paying for The Centre.\nThe Centre will probably be the maker of kings in the next parliament, for as previously said, the PLR and the UDC no longer obtain the majority in the National Council. There will be thematic coalitions and the party can choose if and how it wants to collaborate with the right or with the left according to the themes. However, the centre of the political equator, which includes Le Centre, the evangelical Party (PEV) and the liberal Greens, is generally weakened, with the Liberal Greens having significantly reduced by losing six seats on the National Council.\n\u201cThe Centre will probably be the maker of kings in the next parliament\u201d\nThe Centre and the PLR are traditionally highly represented in the Council of States. For their part, the PS and the UDC, the two polarized parties that are the strongest in the National Council are clearly underrepresented.\nThis is due to the fact that the election to the Council of States takes place in most cases in the majority system. In order to get elected there, we need personalities able to mobilize outside their own camp. The parties that adopt very pronounced positions are less successful.\nWe expected a further weakening of the PS for the Council of States, but things did not appear so bad for him. For example, the party managed to win a seat in Neuch\u00e2tel, which is a surprise. In other cantons, a second round is planned and departure situations are different. But in the end, the PS was able to maintain relatively well. And the UDC was also able to improve its representation on the Council of States.\nIn principle, economic policy and liberal concerns were not at the forefront of this electoral campaign. The electorate therefore did not have to position itself in relation to these themes. These issues will likely need to be renegotiate later in the context of concrete business, in Parliament and, as appropriate, directly during voting.\nWe will then see whether this strengthening of the UDC will affect these issues. But this is not necessarily the case. In the past, the UDPC has already made progress in elections, but it does not translate into popular voting success \u2013 often the population did not follow it on its political themes.\nPersonally, I find it a little sad that the representation of women in Parliament decreases. This is due to the fact that the UDPC is practically the only party that has not presented more women in these elections. However, if the UDC wins, the proportion decreases accordingly.\nWe must not lose sight of this evolution, which was one of the main features of the 2019 elections. Equality played less role in this election campaign. The representation of women only succeeds if the parties develop and support female candidates - which is not automatism.\nI do not expect any change at the Federal Council level. The question of whether the Green-e-s could claim a seat has been discussed for a long time, but it has no chance at the moment.\nThe Centre's question remains. According to the magic formula \u2013 starting from the principle that the four strongest parties are represented in the Federal Council with two seats for each of the three largest and one seat for the smallest \u2013 The Centre could claim one of the two PLR seats.\nBut the Centre has already indicated that it would not revoke existing federal advisors. The composition of the government will probably remain unchanged at this time. The question may only arise in the event of a vacancy, if one of the two PLR seats is released.

Daniel Jositsch confirms that, the starting point of the inquiry stems from a\nof the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung (NZZ) on the Swiss financing of Palestinian non-governmental organizations (NGOs).\nIn July, the great Zurich daily published a detailed survey of Switzerland's commitment to the Palestinian territories and Israel, based in particular on a list of NGOs provided by the Federal Department for Foreign Affairs (DFAE) under the Transparency Act.\nAccording to the newspaper, Switzerland funds directly or indirectly more than 70 Palestinian organizations and projects. With the risk of financing NGOs that unilaterally take sides against Israel or express anti-Semitic opinions. In the list, three names are hidden, so as not to compromise the security of organizations or because their publication could harm \"the political interests of Switzerland\" (as the DFAE says to the NZZ).\nThe NZZ is\nin September on the issue of financing Palestinian NGOs. According to the daily newspaper, DFAE supports \"almost exclusively organizations that criticize Israeli policy - but almost none that blame the human rights situation in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, whose responsibility lies with Hamas and Fatah.\"\nIndirect support to organizations that support\nfor the boycott of Israel would be particularly problematic, although the government has always stated that the Confederation has never supported any campaign calling for the boycott of Israeli products.\nThe NZZ data and evaluations were questioned, inter alia, by\n. Switzerland would actually finance 25 Israeli NGOs and 33 Palestinians. Roland Dittli, a collaborator of the foundation, has\nin the columns of the weekly Wochenzeitung (Woz) to the accusations of unilateralism of Palestinian NGOs: \"The lists contain some of the largest Palestinian human rights organizations, known for their criticism,\" to the West Bank authorities and the Hamas government in Gaza.\nAnswering\nThe government declared at the end of September: \"In 2017, Switzerland provided financial support to 70 non-governmental organizations in the Near East. These include Palestinian, Israeli and third-country NGOs. A attribution to one of these categories is not always obvious and one may wonder if it is relevant.\"\nHowever, Switzerland's commitment to Israel and Palestine is the subject of great attention by Parliament. Seven parliamentary speeches on the subject were delivered at the September only session of the Federal Assembly. In addition to the questions of Daniel Jositsch, mention should be made of\nof the Liberal-radical National Councillor Hans-Ulrich Bigler requesting a report on the financing of Palestinian and Israeli NGOs, not to mention\nMember of Parliament for the Democratic Union of the Centre (UDC / conservative right) Maximilian Reimann, who asked for clarifications on the hidden names of the DFAE list.\nUDC National Councillor\nand the President of the CDP\nThey point to the Geneva Initiative, a peace proposal launched fifteen years ago by Micheline Calmy-Rey, then Swiss Foreign Minister, and which continues to benefit from the financial support of Switzerland.\nLast May, today's Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said that \"by supporting UNRWA (the United Nations organization for Palestinian refugees), we are maintaining the conflict alive\" in the Middle East, causing a great impetus. Subsequently, the Federal Council reiterated its support for the URBWA. Support again pointed out by the Liberal-radical MP\nand the UDC National Councillor\n.\nMore\n\nIn comparison to other countries, Switzerland is distinguished by its legendary stability.

                "en_content": "In front of an alternative bar in the city of Zurich stands the following panel: \u201cHere, racism is not tolerated, or sexism, even less homophobia or other form of discrimination.\u201d But the word \"anti-Semitism\", he does not appear in the list. Along this bar with its stroller, Amir Malcus is not quite surprised. \"Typique de la gauche\", comments this 37-year-old social worker.\nFor a long time activist on the left, he is now disappointed with his own political family. \"For me it is frustrating to see how anti-Semitism spread to the midst of the society where I put the most hope,\" he deplored.\nFor anti-Semitism bites the whole society, including on the left of the political chess. SWI swissinfo.ch interviewed some members of the Jewish community of Switzerland, history specialists, members of political circles and activists declaring themselves to the left, to know how they and they perceive this phenomenon.\nWhere Amir Malcus grew up in a remote valley of Switzerland, anti-Semitism was part of the furniture, he remembers. When he was a squatter, one day he had been able to try to deconstruct, among his squat comrades, some of the stereotypes related to the Jewish community. \u201cNo, not all Jews are rich,\u201d he had to explain. But when he ventured out of his valley, he realized that anti-Semitism was also widespread elsewhere.\nDuring meetings, he was regularly witnessing verbal slippages on Israel, without direct contact with them. \u201cI have heard phrases such as \u2018We will burn your country\u2019,\u201d he says. During demonstrations against the war in Iraq or the Economic Forum in Davos, Marcus said that he was disturbed by the use of cartoons to criticize capitalism but with anti-Semitic hints. Notably Judaophobic images where we see so-called \u201cmarionnetists\u201d pulling the strings of everything.\nMore\n\nThe use of anti-Semitic explanations during crises has lasted for centuries. Switzerland also has a long history in this area.\nIn 2016, a case had shaken the Swiss Socialist Youth in a campaign for a vote. To caricature a \u201cspeculator\u201d, a campaign poster filled it with stereotypes related to Jews: long nose, high-form, papillotes.\n\"Anti-Semitism is a chameleon,\" says Dina Wyler of the Foundation against Racism and Anti-Semitism (GRA). It always adapts to current accounts and often manifests itself through visual language or coded words, in order to remain 'presentable'. \u00bb\nIn Switzerland, the left tolerated the diatribes directed against the State of Israel well before what Marcus experienced in the 2000s. During the Second World War, then a schoolboy, the Zurich politician Emanuel Hurwitz was throwing stones and agonizing anti-Semitic insults. He remembered it until his last breath.\n\"Later, I was not confronted with such uncomplexed anti-Semitism in the left,\" he confessed to SWI swissinfo.ch at the end of his life. After his studies, he joined the ranks of the Swiss socialist party. Emanuel Hurwitz, elected in 1979 in the canton of Zurich, had remained faithful to the left. In the 1970s, he argued that the PS's position on the conflict in the Middle East was \"reflected.\"\nBut it had changed in 1982 with the beginning of the war in Lebanon. Israel suddenly appeared under the traits of the attacker. \u201cThis is when a form of hysteria took hold of the PS,\u201d he said. Elected from the left of Jewish confession, Emanuel Hurwitz was regularly invited to participate in round tables to evoke the subject.\nThese debates proved to be, he said, \u201cof pure propaganda for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)\u201d. He said he was struck by the Manichean arguments used. \u201cIsrael was then the absolute evil, while the PLO\u2019s position was approved in a general enthusiasm.\u201d\n\u201cThis hatred and fanaticism\u201d had surprised and decented him. A demonisation that was equivalent to a form of anti-Semitism. A professional psychiatrist, Emanuel Hurwitz tried to alert his own troops, explaining to his party comrades how the prejudices erupted could quickly rise to the surface in political situations.\nOn the left, many had made the deaf ear. On 1 May 1984, Emanuel Hurwitz had therefore decided to resign - both from the cantonal legislature and the socialist party - on the grounds that no debate on this issue had ever been held seriously. \"This long silence lasted 40 years,\" he explained.\nSince 2019, the Swiss PS and its cantonal sections have decided to adopt, as a definition of anti-Semitism, the one promulgated by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). And this definition includes anti-Semitism in connection with Israel. A \"tardive\" awareness told us Emanuel Hurwitz, stating, shortly before his death last February at 86, that this shift had a special taste for him.\nA long-standing friendship had linked Emanuel Hurwitz to Berthold Rothschild, another Zurich politician, but who had joined the Swiss Labour Party, communist obedience, in the 1980s. According to the latter, the communists have long considered Israel to be a \u201cheroic nation\u201d, because of the way that this state has built itself. \"Then everything has shifted,\" he analyses. Shortly before he deserted the ranks of his party, he assured that he had observed a resurgence of stereotypes in his political family. It was said, for example, that members of the Jewish community tended to betray the left.\nThe war in the Middle East then obviously shook it, generating internal dilemmas. Among his comrades, several were \"a blinded by the hatred of the Jew, such as Lebanese Hezbollah or the Palestinian Hamas movement would speak to it,\" he explained. Berthold Rothschild didn\u2019t hold it to them, even though he had sometimes left meetings after hearing offensive remarks. From its point of view, Israel's policy and the fate of the Palestinian-nes inevitably indign as much to the left. \u201cA often justified indignation,\u201d he says.\nHe takes the example of one of his friends, who was engaged on the ground in the Middle East where she helped the people of Gaza. \"I understand that one becomes a propalestinian when one lives such a situation on a daily basis,\" he says. But Berthold Rothschild adds as soon as it can also lead to \"an anti-Israeli position at the limit of fanaticism\". \"Being anti-Israeli does not mean being anti-Semitic, but the red line is fine,\" he warns. For him, anti-Semitism is a repressed theme on the left.\n\u201cIn order to avoid potential disrapies, activists and activists should keep an eye out for every moment,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I am aware that society can transmit its racist hints to me, I hope that at least others are as conscious of it.\u201d Among his comrades on the left, several of them do not hesitate to submit flyers or political programmes before printing to him to find out if, according to his expertise, these texts might induce some prejudices. \"Exemptions,\" he said.\nFor Erik Petry, Deputy Director of the Centre for Jewish Studies at the University of Basel, \"it is necessary to gauge each situation on a case-by-case basis\". But \u201ca toxic mixture can appear, he says, if we do not objectively criticize Israel\u2019s policy and if we emit the hypothesis that immoral behaviors have a direct connection to Judaity.\u201d The left has produced some examples.\nBut in these conditions, the right has beautiful game of fustiger the anti-Semitism of the left, nuance Christina Sp\u00e4ti. Professor of History at the University of Freiburg, she believes that the right also attempts to \u201cwash hands\u201d with all anti-Semitism. However, she confirms, a left-wing anti-Semitism exists.\nThere is also a thesis: \"The Swiss left and Israel - Enthusiasm for Israel, anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism between 1967 and 1991\". The academic has identified and classified articles and incidents highlighting the existence of anti-Semitic resentments in the left-wing circles at that time.\nIn 1970, for example, the socialist press had published a comment fustigating the capture of Nazi Adolf Eichmann by an Israeli commando sent to Argentina, calling it \"gifle to the face of Argentina\". In the 1980s, a large newspaper of the Helvetic left had compared Israel's \"final solution\" policy, which had led millions of Jews and Jews to extermination.\nChristina Sp\u00e4ti has compiled other examples in this sense. At the time, the commentary on the capture of Adolf Eichmann had certainly caused a toll because of his primary anti-Semitism, but other articles written more subtly were, they, passed to the back of the net\u2019s stitches. The historian argues that \u201cthe left would have squeezed a form of indifference about anti-Semitism\u201d. Germany began reflection in the 1990s but without real effect in Switzerland, she told SWI swissinfo.ch.\nFarouchement opposed to any anti-Semitism, a left-wing activist has yet narrated to us how, in the 1990s, her policies threatened her to \u201cshoot her in the knee\u201d at a briefing session in Zurich, she said that the subject was rather clivant. Or that in the early 2000s, a text and a cartoon on the Indymedia platform had triggered a fierce debate on the left. A criminal complaint had been filed, but Indymedia Switzerland had not withdrawn the doubtful content, while its owners had ruled the anti-Semitic nature. For some years, Christina Sp\u00e4ti has noted the change in left circles in Switzerland, in particular the desire to die.\nIn this \"dynamics of climbing\", friendships broke, according to the Zurich left newspaper Wochenzeitung (WOZ). In particular, the WoZ had quoted the words of a left-wing political leader, who claimed that racism could \u201cin principle not be combated by State instruments\u201d, like the anti-racist criminal standard. A position that no one on the left would publicly express twenty years later. In recent years, feminist and anti-racist movements have made widespread awareness of discrimination.\n\nSign up for our free newsletter and receive our best items in your mailbox.\nBut nothing says that hints of anti-Semitism do not go up to the surface, also to the left, according to well-known patterns. This is at least what emerges from echoes that we gathered from young Jewish activists in Switzerland. Interviewed by SWI swissinfo.ch, Anna Rosenwasser, a young 30-year-old half-Jewish, is active on social networks. \u201cI\u2019m concerned with anti-Semitism... and not just half,\u201d she said. On Instagram, where it is positioned on voting themes related to feminist and queer causes, about 25,000 people follow it regularly today.\nAnna Rosenwasser considers that the anti-Semitism of the left is not the most threatening. For her, the level of requirement is higher on the left. \"It is clear to me that the left needs a conscious approach to anti-Semitism,\" she said. Anti-Semitic patterns of thought are widespread in our society. To know and think about them is an important antifascist mission in my eyes.\"\nA member of the Swiss Foundation against Racism and Anti-Semitism, Dina Wyler has a lot in this direction. According to her, many people still believe that the Jewish community enjoys privileges and cannot therefore be discriminated against. \"On the left also, they are denied this experience of discrimination,\" she concludes.\nArticles mentioned\nAnti-Semitism Series in Switzerland\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

After eleven days of intense fighting, a ceasefire was negotiated on 21 May, mainly through the mediation of Egypt and the United Nations. It provides for a mutual and simultaneous cessation of hostilities.\nLike the others, this recent outbreak of violence affected mainly the civilian population: more than 230 Palestinians and 11 Israelis were killed. The number of injuries per thousand and the damage to infrastructure is enormous, especially in the Gaza Strip.\nWhile the fighting was still raging, the Jewish organizations in Switzerland reiterated their demand to classify Hamas among terrorist organizations. In one\nthe Swiss Federation of Israel\u2019s Communities (FSCI) and the Swiss Liberal Jewish Platform (PJLS) present Hamas as \u201clightly extremist, terrorist and anti-Semitic\u201d and are indignant that in Switzerland, \u201cHamas is going and comes at its own discretion, collecting donations and going to its financial operations\u201d. The two organisations \u201crequire\u201d from Switzerland, therefore, that they see their position again. The Israeli embassy in Bern asked for the same thing.\nThe claim is not new: in 2017, the national advisor UDC (preservative right) Christian Imark had\nthe Federal Council to prohibit or classify Hamas among terrorist organizations. After the recent escalation, the soothing elect told us that, according to him, \u201cthis ranking would always be correct, especially because Hamas appears again as an attacker and uses its own population as a human shield\u201d.\nIn fact, Switzerland has so far declared only Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (Daesh) as terrorist organizations. This means that direct discussions are impossible between them and the Helvetic government. And that is also why the Federal Council never wanted to access the Hamas demand. As part of its peace policy in the region, it is important to speak to all actors and to be able to offer the good offices of Switzerland. Both between Israel and the Palestinians and the inter-Palestinian dialogue between Islamic Hamas and the lay Fatah.\nRecent episodes of violence have not changed anything. \"The DFAE took note of FSCI's request. The position of Switzerland [...] remains valid. Hamas denies the right to Israel\u2019s existence and defends the armed struggle as a legitimate means of resistance. Switzerland condemns these positions very clearly,\" the Department of Foreign Affairs tells us.\nAnd to recall that Switzerland was in contact with all parties in conflict and also called on Hamas in Gaza to end all acts of violence and respect humanitarian and human rights law.\nThere are several reasons why the European Union has not played a major role in negotiating the ceasefire. Having classified Hamas as a terrorist organization, the EU cannot lead direct discussions with it \u2013 which is also the case for many other states. Some consider it terrorist only the Hamas military branch, not the organization as a whole.\nAfter the violence in recent weeks, the pressure to classify Hamas as a terrorist movement has risen in several countries. The candidate for the German Federal Chancellery, Christian Democrat Armin Laschet, asks, for example, that the Hamas flag be banned, while others call for the total ban of the organization.\nThe question is, however, how productive a ban would be. According to analysts, Hamas became the most important political force for Palestinians. Beyond the Gaza Strip, which he has been leading since 2007, he is gaining more and more support in the West Bank and among the Israeli Arabs. In an interview\n, the expert from the Near East Erich Gysling summed up the dilemma: \"Hamas is the political winner on the Palestinian side. We have to keep talking to him. Ranking him as a terrorist does not help anyone.\u201d\nMore\nDiscussion\nSwitzerland refuses to consider Hamas as a terrorist organization.

It\u2019s not nice to wake up like this, but we already know what to do. From the moment the siren sounds, we have a minute and a half to go to a bunker.\nThe situation on the ground in the RTS Telejournal of 9 October 2023\nBut there is no shelter in the old building where we live. We go to the stairwell, growing as far as possible from the windows. The staircase is the strongest part of a building.\nWhen the Iron Dome shield intercepts the rocket, we hear a boom. Then you have to wait another ten minutes. Saturday morning, we had a few alerts, and then three in the evening. Since then, it\u2019s quieter. Earlier, I heard a new alert, but not directly in our neighbourhood.\nExactly. The international company of high technology in which I work supports us very much in this situation. We work when we can. At the moment, the people I work with in Israel work for the most part intermittently, because many of them have to deal with children at the same time. Friends of a colleague are missing.\nMany had to join the army as reservists. Work is good for me. This allows me to distract myself, otherwise I would be constantly on news and social networks, to scroll through these images.\nI don't comment on that kind of thing. I get mad personally when I see something.\nFor my part, I have not heard of anyone residing here who thinks of leaving. But my colleague from the Council of Switzerland abroad apparently received numerous calls. For me, it wouldn't be an option to go home.\nLike most Swiss in Israel, I have double nationality. I did my\n\nin 2014. The Israeli State supports all Jewish people throughout the world for the entry and obtaining of citizenship.\nSo I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to go back to Switzerland, but I also consider myself Switzerlandsse, Switzerlandsse from abroad precisely. That is why I also commit myself to this community.\nMore\n\nIn comparison to other countries, Switzerland is distinguished by its legendary stability. How does she explain?\nOn Saturday evening, we received a useful e-mail from the embassy informing us about how to announce itself through the TravelAdmin app. But this was of course for the Swiss residents here \u2013 not for the Swiss on holiday.\nFor tourists, it was probably more difficult. I heard that some did not know how to contact the embassy. Of course, it is important that anyone wishing to return may find a flight. I find it very difficult.\nFor the moment, we do not know whether there will still be emergency flights from Switzerland. However, I am not involved, but I am trying to be present for my compatriots who live here in the event of a problem.\nSwitzerland must absolutely recognize Hamas as a terrorist organization. I read in the media that the \u201cSwiss-Palestine Parliamentary Friendship Group\u201d was about to disappear. I think this is a good thing.\nWhat I think is rather critical is that until Monday afternoon, no member of the Federal Council had yet clearly condemned the attack on Hamas. Maybe neutrality doesn't allow it, but I think that's a question.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the EU, the United States or Great Britain, Switzerland, a neutral state, does not mean Hamas as a terrorist organization.\nProtesting is the only thing you can do. You can write us and think of us. In Israel, we support each other mentally. But I also receive a lot of messages from Switzerland and many also contact my parents who live in Switzerland. It\u2019s also good for my parents. The sympathy is very big.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "en_content": "As a result of Hamas\u2019 attacks in Israel, the Swiss government is considering calling the Palestinian militant group as a terrorist organization, as the European Union, Canada and the United States have done. swissinfo.ch met with Riccardo Bocco, professor emeritus at the Institute of High International Studies and Development (IHEID) in Geneva, to understand what it would mean for Switzerland and what role the country could play in a peace process.\nRiccardo Bocco: Switzerland's previous dialogue with Hamas has enabled the country to play an effective mediator in the conflicts and negotiations that have passed because of its neutrality. The desire to describe Hamas as a terrorist organization is in contradiction with the historical neutrality of Switzerland and its role as a mediator. This may impair its ability to navigate and serve as a mediator in future regional conflicts and negotiations, such as the release of hostages or the facilitation of dialogue between parties in conflict.\nSwitzerland should take advantage of its tradition of neutrality and play an intermediary role without taking the party of Israel or Palestine. It is possible to recognize that both parties have committed war crimes, taking into account the actions of Hamas and Israel\u2019s response. Switzerland can provide valuable service by cautioning against a potential intensification of hostilities, such as Israel\u2019s land invasion in Gaza, underlining the risk of an increase in war crimes. But to do so, the Swiss Ministry of Foreign Affairs must have the necessary strength and determination, which is of concern given its apparent weakness.\nAfter the Oslo Accords in 1993 (signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization), Switzerland set up a group of diplomats who effectively committed themselves to Palestine. Today, this political will no longer exists. Swiss diplomats are less numerous and less well prepared. This poses an important problem for the diplomatic efforts of Switzerland in the region.\nThe Gaza population exceeds two million and the vast majority are refugees who benefit from the assistance of UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East). An organization that partly finances Switzerland. It should therefore strongly support UNRWA, which is the only United Nations agency to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinian refugees. It is important to note that the more than six million Palestinian refugees in the region do not enjoy any legal protection from any agency, which makes them particularly vulnerable worldwide.\nUNHCR (Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) and UNRWA both deal with refugees, but have separate mandates and areas of intervention, particularly with regard to Palestinians and Palestinians:\nAt the diplomatic level, if Switzerland reduces its humanitarian assistance, it is equivalent to a \"suicide\". On what basis would it stop humanitarian aid? The allegations that Hamas would divert the aid money are not verified. The allocation of international assistance to Gaza has become a sophisticated mechanism, which guarantees in-depth controls over the beneficiaries and expenses of the funds. The European Union, which provides significant financial assistance, uses a specific mechanism, called PEGASE, to ensure that funds reach the associations and institutions concerned. Therefore, even if financial mismanagement may exist, any allegation must be supported by clear examples rather than propagating unaudited statements.\nToday, a two-State solution seems unpleasant. The current Israeli logic is that of one State. On the legal level, Israel has developed, within its administration of the occupied territories, laws that discriminate, separate and move the Palestinian people. The issue of racial discrimination in Israel has been increasingly highlighted since 2017, when the United Nations issued a report accusing Israel of apartheid towards the Palestinian population.\nThe failure of the two-State solution, illustrated by the difficulties of the Geneva Initiative (an initiative brought by Israeli and Palestinian civil societies launched in 2003), suggests that alternative solutions, such as a federalist model, should be considered. The exploration of new models of peacebuilding, such as federalism, depends largely on the willingness of the parties concerned to exceed established political and territorial positions. This complex and multifaceted issue requires international and local engagement.\nMore\n\nIn its relations with the European Union, Switzerland is playing a dangerous game of balancing, which could also come out losing.\nVarious Palestinian and Israeli organizations explore alternative models. This includes the \u201csolution of a single democratic State\u201d, a \u201cbinational State\u201d and a \u201cfederation\u201d. However, it is currently difficult to discuss these options in detail and move towards one of them because of the ongoing war. It is essential to wait for its outcome to explore further these options.\nThis is the legal and constitutional architecture of the state. Israel, which is defined as a Jewish democratic state without full constitution, navigates between delicate religious and political balances. A \u201cUniitarian democratic state\u201d would require equal status for all citizens of Jewish and Palestinian origin, and a defined constitution guaranteeing equal rights. On the other hand, a \u201cbinational state\u201d could offer different political structures to the two national groups, but it must be carefully planned to avoid internal conflicts and ensure equitable representation and rights for all. The exploration of these models requires careful consideration of the various religious and political perspectives in the region.\nA \u201cbinational state\u201d implies recognition of the right to self-determination for the Israeli and Palestinian Jewish people. In its 2018 National State Bill, Israel stated that only Jewish Israelis and Israelis had the right to self-determination. But this right was essential in decolonization in other regions such as Africa and India.\n\n\n\n\nThe opinion of the former Swiss Foreign Minister on Swiss neutrality in the face of war in Ukraine.\nLooking at past efforts, such as those that followed the Oslo Accords, there is an important lesson on the need to strictly enforce and respect international law in peacebuilding processes. Despite the agreements, actions such as the confiscation of land by Israel after 1994 took place without intervention or significant international consequences. Europe and the United States have not ensured that the parties concerned strictly respect international law and standards. It is essential to hold the parties responsible for their actions. States must respect legal and ethical standards and not allow their geopolitical or diplomatic relations to temper their legal and fair practices requirements in the context of the resolution of international conflicts.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "en_content": "ASO speaks of \"citizens: second class\" and \"discipline\" when it comes to political rights. This is because the problem remains unresolved that the return and return of voting documents on the postal route of many places cannot take place in time.\nThose who live abroad often cannot vote or vote, although there is a right to vote since 1992. Here we show how many foreign citizens are affected: inside and how a solution without e-voting could look:\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland must send its tuning couverts for fifth Switzerland three weeks earlier. The delay problem would be done.\nIn the Federal Elections 2023, many cantons have responded to this challenge and sent their electoral mail earlier. But not all:\nMore\n\n\n\n\nWe asked the cantons when they sent the documents. Who has made special efforts and who has failed?\nSince 2023, many citizens abroad have also hoped that e-voting will be introduced on a broad basis. Switzerland started in June 2023 with a new series of experiments, first in three cantons.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe experiments with e-voting in three cantons were successful. The participation of Swiss foreigners has increased.\nThis after e-voting was previously completely set for security and cost reasons.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nTwo software professionals explain the Swiss debakel for electronic voting.\nIn the election year 2023, the concerns of the Swiss Swiss abroad came back to the focus. Swiss politics has discovered the value of this electorate.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland starts a year of election. The parties realize that Swiss people can become decisive abroad.\nAnd the parties have realized that with the needs of the Fifth Switzerland votes have to be taken.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nWhat can Swiss foreigners expect from politics? Parliamentarians: in \"Let's Talk\" they deliver the answer.\nHowever, the right to vote and vote of the Swiss foreign nationals arises: in the case of the State, there is also a duty to make this possible in fact? Some doubt.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe anger about lately arriving electoral documents raises the question: does Switzerland have to make sure that Swiss foreigners can choose?\nMany foreign Swiss people see further discrimination: in the absence of representation in the Swiss Parliament. In contrast to France, Switzerland does not know any guaranteed expat representation in the country parliament.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe defence of the interests of Swiss foreigners is not really one of the priorities of Parliament, says the political scientist Marc B\u00fchlmann.\nThis is astonishing in view of the size of this Electorate, it is comparable with 230'000 voters with a larger Swiss canton. Attempts to bring about a little movement in political representation had little success.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe left can profit from the idea of a canton for foreign Switzerland. Right not.\nSwiss people are experiencing further discrimination abroad if they want to keep an account with a Swiss bank. After 2008, they assumed their relations with customers residing abroad. Or they will bury their foreign customers with high fees.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nIn the best case, a bank account costs three times. In extreme cases, 31 times. How do banks justify their prices? And how honest are they?\nIn politics, the opinion prevailed that the state of the private sector should not speak in.\nThe same is the argument with the health insurance companies. In particular, older citizens: in non-EU/Efta countries, there are hardly any financially portable insurance solutions, a further disadvantage.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nA postulate wants to allow foreign Swiss: to stay in basic insurance. But the Federal Council does not see any reason to act.\nIn 2021 the Covid19 pandemic prevailed. Again, many Swiss abroad felt discriminated. Be it because their vaccinations in Switzerland have not been recognised or because Switzerland has not made vaccinations available to them.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe large inoculation in Switzerland has begun. Swiss people abroad are leaving empty.\nFinally, the foreign Swiss organization is also facing substantial challenges. The democratic legitimation of the Swiss Foreign Council is increasingly being questioned. This is often referred to as Parliament of Fifth Switzerland.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe Swiss Foreign Council is the language tube of the Fifth Switzerland in Germany. His voice has weight. To keep it, it needs more democracy.\nThe Council, however, is a large body of delegates from the various international Swiss associations. A system which allows more representative, more democratic composition is sought.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nChange needs and democracy. At the 99th session of the Swiss Foreign Council, young delegates are holding their own deficits to the old Council.\nThe question should be dealt with by the Swiss foreign organisation in the next few years. Because a change is necessary which cannot simply be called up centrally or can be prescribed from above.\nMore\n\nDo you want to stay informed abroad? Now our app SWIplus offers even more Switzerland: with news, stories and our briefing!\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "en_content": "As a voice counter: in Switzerland you don't earn badly: about 40 francs in the hour.\nThis makes counting votes for elections and voting in many Swiss villages and cities a popular side job for students. But despite the solid wages, some communities have trouble finding willing helpers: find them and advertise on job portals on the Internet.\nThere is often talk about a \"responsible and exciting task\". On the other hand, administrative workers are motivated.\nThe fact that there are so many voice counters: inside, only surprises at first glance: In no country in the world there are so many referendums as in Switzerland. Like the elections, they are local, cantonal and national. So it takes many hands that are waving through the envelopes and counting out who or what concerns lies ahead.\nFor some, however, the counting of votes is just civil duty and part of the lived direct democracy \u2013 also unpaid.\nAnita Casanova and Rosmarie Steinmann are two such persons. In a glazed meeting room on the second floor of the municipal house of Regensdorf, half an hour drive from Zurich, they tell why they work as voice counters. They like to tell you about it.\nHowever, a lot of time should not take advantage of the conversation, because after the two have spent the morning monitoring the vote release at the urns, the strict part still stands: the inclusion of the numbers in the cantonal voting software.\nStable land, stable money, stable life plans: In an international comparison, a lot runs around Switzerland.\nIn this series SWI swissinfo.ch deals with trust in institutions, this basis for working democracies.\nWe go to the question of where the historical causes are that for some in Switzerland boredom is the greatest problem, as it is about the confidence in the present \u2013 and what stumbling stones are coming to Switzerland.\nOn this Sunday in winter, the canton of Zurich chooses and on this Sunday the entire country looks to Zurich, because if the most populous canton of Switzerland is chosen, this is always a sign of Swiss elections in October.\nRosmarie Steinmann was elected as an election office member for the third time, before her retirement she worked on the municipality. Anita Casanova, who has been working for the municipality of Regensdorf for 25 years, is also in the third term. She says: \u201cAt urn service you can chat with people, these are always very beautiful encounters. \u2018\nThe number of voice counters is also dependent on how many topics are coordinated. In the case of large elections, the personnel effort is several times higher than in normal urns. In the Z\u00fcrcher elections, a total of 70 people were employed, including administrative staff. For emptying the urns, checking and recording were formed each team.\nRegensdorf with its around 19'000 inhabitants: Inside is a bridge between the left city of Zurich and the rural, rather right-wing surrounding communities.\n\"If someone asks me where I live, and I say in Regensdorf, it sometimes says: Ah, in prison.\" Anita Casanova smiles: \"I don't think that's bad when I'm in the mood, I'll play with and say, 'Yes, I'm an insassin and I'm just free!'\" Rosmarie Steinmann knows these sayings, she has lived here for 46 years: \"I used to ask people: 'Ah Regensdorf? Internal or external?'\" The two women take it with humor.\nYou know Regensdorf now either because of the shopping mall or because of the P\u00f6schwies detention centre, the biggest prison in the country.\nThe municipality of Regensdorf is regarded as somewhat sleepy. There is no cinema, no swimming pool, no historical village centre.\nAnd yet the two women don't want to leave here. Rosmarie Steinmann says: \"Regensdorf in itself is not a place to have seen. But people hold one here.\" She's moved three times in Regensdorf.\nMore\nDebates\nA basis for democracies is trust in justice, politics, police and the media. That is why we are dealing with the issue \u2013 and ask.\nAnita Casanova was born in Austria, grew up in Regensdorf, went to school here, to vocational training and then started as a community worker.\nAs much as the people they hold in Regensdorf are, so much Steinmann and Casanova are repeatedly surprised in terms of political participation by the deep participation of the Regensdorfers: both negatively \u2013 so also on this Sunday.\n\"My colleague had brought her ballot this morning so that at least one is in the urn. After one and a half hours we went back to the Voting Office of the municipality of Regensdorf with ten voting cards,\" says Steinmann.\n\"I always find it very bad when people say, 'I can't agree!' And if I ask if they have chosen, they shake their head,\" says Anita Casanova. Why no more people take part in national elections and votes, it is a mystery. The direct democracy in Switzerland recognizes it as a privilege: \"The saying 'The politicians: they do whatever they want' is no longer valid. If no one expresses his opinion, you cannot complain afterwards.\"\nThe two rain villagers, however, do not only deal with the deep participation of voices, but they all perceive a dizzying interest in engaging in society. Those who do it are always the same in Regensdorf, says Casanova. Steinmann: \"I think this is the same thing as it happens in association at the end of the day.\"\nFor a long time, she was the president of the women's tournament in the place, but finding a succession was difficult. \"Only when it comes to who is to write the protocol, all look to the ground. Everyone wants to benefit, but when it comes to contributing something, all open laces suddenly have!\"\nCasonova sums up: \"Nobody wants to work more in associations or volunteers.\" There are almost 90 clubs in Regensdorf \u2013 that as well as all fight with junior problems is a bad sign.\nA secret recipe for more engagement \u2013 whether political or social \u2013 do not know the two women, but they see potential. \"In the Watt district there is a voting caf\u00e9 in the Vocal, which is operated by the Watt Cultural Association. This motivates the voters and one can exchange views among one another,\" says Casanova, adding: \"On the contrary, the possibility of voting by app does not seem to be encouraging.\"\nIn addition, Casanova and Steinmann agree that the boys already spend too much time in front of the cell phone or computer \u2013 time that you could invest in other things, whether in an association, in political engagement or in neighbourhood aid.\nBefore the two women take part in the evaluation of the collected voices, there is still time for a quick political prognosis: \"If it comes as I have filled it, it would be mixed colorfully,\" says Rosmarie Steinmann diplomatically. Anita Casanova, on the other hand, predicts a slight right-hand slide.\nIn the evening it is clear: Steinmann and Casanova keep double right. It comes to a slight right-wing slide \u2013 and the turnout is deep. In Regensdorf, only about every fourth person entitled to vote took part in the vote, and in the entire canton of Zurich it was only about 35%.\nBut the commitment of people like Steinmann and Casanova keeps the transmission of democracy on track.\nIn Switzerland, more than 80% of the votes are delivered by post before the actual election day. In most cantons, it is necessary to sign the so-called 'voice' card', which is issued with the voting or election decision closed in a Couvert. The vote will first check whether the signature is present on the voting card. If she fails, the voice is invalid.\nOn the other hand, it is more complicated to choose, because on the one hand, voters can simply enter the list of a party, on the other hand they can combine the names on the list as desired. The unchanged are counted by hand \u2013 by several people to avoid errors. There is an additional intermediate step in the changed dials because it is necessary to check whether the adjustments have been made correct when changing.\nThe cantons of Basel-Stadt and Geneva, as well as other cities and villages, now rely on machine-readable ballots that automatically capture the cross on the note. Others, such as the village of Maur in the canton of Zurich, are counting on precision scales when voting.\nMore\n\nHow can Switzerland ensure that their citizens are not discriminated against abroad?\nArticles in this story\nSet ingredients of trust and stability\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

Die Armut nimmt t\u00e4glich zu und die Politik ist eng verflochten mit der Wirtschaft, der Inflation und der Unsicherheit.\"",
                    "Momentan ist offen, ob in Argentinien die Mitte-Links-Regierung unter dem bisherigen Wirtschaftsminister Sergio Massa als neuem Pr\u00e4sidenten fortgesetzt wird, es mit der Oppositionskandidatin Patricia Bullrich zu einer konservativen Wende kommt oder ob der Outsider-Kandidat Javier Milei regieren wird.",
                    "Poma, die \"aus b\u00fcrgerlicher Pflicht\"\u00a0in der Schweiz und in Argentinien w\u00e4hlt, weiss noch nicht, f\u00fcr wen sie sich entscheiden wird. Doch nach den Wahlen werde es schwierig f\u00fcr die neue Regierung. \"Wer auch immer gewinnt, wird enorme Schwierigkeiten haben zu regieren\", sagt Poma.",
                    "Diese argentinischen Wahlen erlangen international besondere Aufmerksamkeit, denn das Wahlb\u00fcndnis von Milei gewann die Vorwahlen im August mit einem Anteil von 30% und erreichte in 16 von 24 Wahlbezirken die meisten Stimmen. Argentinische Medien schrieben am Tag nach den Wahlen vom \"",

                    "Milei ist ein rechtslibert\u00e4rer \u00d6konom, der f\u00fcr freie Liebe eintritt und gleichzeitig Abtreibungen wieder verbieten will. Er leugnet\u00a0den menschgemachten Klimawandel und die Verbrechen der argentinischen Milit\u00e4rdiktatur von 1976\u00a0bis 1983. Wom\u00f6glich kommt nach den Hauptwahlen am 22. Oktober ein weiterer Stichwahlgang \u2013 falls am 22. Oktober niemand mit einem grossen Vorsprung vorne liegt.",
                    "Berni sagt, Wahlk\u00e4mpfe in Argentinien seien immer emotional.\u00a0\"Die Monate vor den Wahlen sind immer sehr angespannt, weil Argentinien stark polarisiert ist. Es gibt nur Schwarz oder Weiss, keine Grauzonen. Egal, wer gew\u00e4hlt wird: Weil dieses Mal drei Lager \u00e4hnlich gross sind, wird es am Ende eine Mehrheit aus Unzufriedenen geben.\"\u00a0",
                    "Die Polarisierung sei schon stark, so lange sie denken kann. Momentan sei nur klar, dass am Ende ein grosser Teil der Bev\u00f6lkerung\u00a0unzufrieden sein wird.",
                    "Die Wahlen f\u00fcr Parlament und Regierung in Argentinien werden entscheiden,\u00a0in welche politische Richtung Argentinien in den n\u00e4chsten Jahren geht.

                "en_content": "Most foreign Swiss: in Latin America live in Argentina. On 22 October 2023 Argentina chooses \u2013 on the same day as Switzerland.\nOf the 15'000 Swiss:insides living in Argentina, almost all have the Argentine passport: 95%. This is the world's highest proportion of double citizens: in the Swiss Diaspora.\nThis means that some people will vote in the same day in both countries. How does that feel? SWI swissinfo.ch asked two Swiss Argentineans.\nAlexia Berni lives in Rosario, the third largest city in Argentina. In Rosario they know almost all Swiss: there is a common feeling and regular meetings in the Swiss association, she says. Among the Swiss: there are few expats in Argentina, but above all double citizens.\n\"The fact that there are so many Swiss in Argentina: in the second or third generation is also due to the fact that you get the Argentine passport when you are born here and the Swiss passport because of the parents, that is, according to the principle of origin,\" explains Berni. The delegate of the Swiss Foreign Council is the daughter of a Swiss emigrant from Graub\u00fcnden.\nThere is a duty to vote in Argentina. If you stay away from the election without a reason, you have to pay a small bus and you must not be placed for a public office for three years.\nBerni has to overcome a few obstacles for Switzerland: \"The participation in Switzerland demands more. In order to exercise political rights from abroad, you have to register actively beforehand, pay the postporto \u2013 which is not cheap for us \u2013 and then you have to hope.\"\nHope the election couvert arrives in time. \"The greatest concern in these elections is whether we can choose,\" says Berni. Sometimes the tuning in Switzerland, sometimes not.\nBerni asked the authorities in Switzerland. It was informed that the municipalities in the canton of Graub\u00fcnden send the voting documents for the Swiss foreigners: within a week before the ordinary shipment.\nThe fact that the voting documents arrive in Argentina in time is not of course: A foreign Swiss from C\u00f3rdoba has even explained to SWI swissinfo.ch that he has never been able to choose in Switzerland for late electoral documents.\nLike Berni, he is also convinced: e-voting would solve many problems for the Swiss double citizens: both inside and out in Argentina.\nThe double citizens are pressing the thumbs that their voices arrive in Switzerland in time. Meanwhile, in Argentina, an electoral campaign is going to die, the outcome of which will make the country more pronounced than the outcome of the elections to Switzerland \u2013 where it is already considered to be the election victory when a party improves its result by one percentage point.\nCarolina Poma, a double citizen: in C\u00f3rdoba and also engaged in the Swiss Foreign Council, says: \"In Argentina we choose a new president in October, in a framework of great social tensions. Poverty increases daily and politics are closely intertwined with economy, inflation and uncertainty.\"\nAt the moment, it is open whether the middle-left government under the former Minister of Economic Affairs Sergio Massa will continue as a new president in Argentina, and with the opposition candidate Patricia Bullrich there will be a conservative turn or whether the outsider candidate Javier Milei will rule.\nPoma, who chooses \"from bourgeois duty\" in Switzerland and Argentina, does not yet know who she will choose. But after the elections it becomes difficult for the new government. \"Whoever wins will have enormous difficulties to govern,\" says Poma.\nThese Argentinian elections receive special attention internationally, as Milei's electoral alliance won the pre-elections in August with a 30% share and reached most votes in 16 out of 24 constituencies. Argentinian media wrote of \"\n\" who has captured the country.\nMilei is a legal-libertarian economist who wants to enter for free love and at the same time ban abortions. He denies human climate change and the crimes of the Argentine military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983. Perhaps after the main elections on the 22nd October another round-off \u2013 if on 22 October no one lies with a big lead.\nBerni says campaigns in Argentina are always emotional. \"The months before the elections are always very tense because Argentina is strongly polarized. There are only black or white, no grey areas. No matter who is elected, because this time three camps are similar, there will be a majority of dissatisfied.\"\nPolarization has been strong as long as it can think. At the moment it is only clear that in the end a large part of the population will be dissatisfied.\nThe elections for Parliament and government in Argentina will decide in what political direction Argentina will take in the next few years. In Switzerland with its concordance government, it is quite clear before the elections that power remains distributed between the parties.\nFor Poma, it feels that it can choose in \"two very different realities\". She perceives Swiss politics as harmonious and organized, \"no matter which party gets the most votes\".\nIn fact, a new study showed that the majority of the Swiss population also perceives their policies as polarised.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nA survey with 6000 people in Switzerland shows the appreciation of direct democracy, but also dissatisfaction and pessimism.\nBy SWI swissinfo.ch, Berni says: \"The difference is that there may be polarized opinions in Switzerland, but the consequences for the country's political direction are less big.\"\nIn Argentina, on the other hand, it has great consequences for living together if this or that party wins. \"Even in Switzerland people think very differently, but in Argentina the polarisation has more social-political consequences,\" says Alexia Berni.\nShe has already decided who she will choose \u2013 in Argentina and Switzerland.\nMore\n\nHow can Switzerland ensure that their citizens are not discriminated against abroad?\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                    "Eine Frage der Perspektive: Es ist wahr, dass sich die Schweizer Wahlen nicht auf einen Machtkampf zwischen zwei, drei Figuren zuspitzen lassen. Aber das ist auch einer der Gr\u00fcnde, der das Schweizer System f\u00fcr eine Analyse interessant macht: Die Pr\u00e4sidentin oder der Pr\u00e4sident hat in der Schweiz \u2013 anders als in Mexiko \u2013 wenig Bedeutung.",

                    "Dies ist vielleicht auch der Grund, warum nicht mal in der Schweiz alle die Namen der Regierungsmitglieder kennen und oft gerade nicht wissen, wer Pr\u00e4sident:in ist.

                "en_content": "At SWI swissinfo.ch in Bern, people from 15 nations work. Our journalists: international backgrounds deal day after day with Switzerland, often live in the country for decades, but they also follow events in the countries where they grew up. Here, six of them tell what makes the elections particularly exciting in Switzerland when you keep a different country in mind: Japan, the USA, Tunisia, Russia, China or Mexico.\nEvery four years national elections take place in Switzerland. The international media give them little attention because the political shifts in stable Switzerland are mostly small. Should Swiss elections get more attention?\n\"The instruments of direct democracy take us away legislators, because we know that the people have the last word. So we pulverize power in Switzerland,\" a Swiss parliamentarian replied, as two Mexican journalists: inside and I asked for a while how the political system of Switzerland works.\nIn fact, good elections in Switzerland are not a blind vote of confidence for the new government after the parliamentary elections. The right of veto of citizens: to oppose legislative decisions is a constant: The regular referendums on initiatives and referendums allow citizens to propose themselves to decide on the federal parliament or to change the constitution.\nI'm from Mexico. Over 25 years ago, I reported to Mexican media houses because I wanted to report as a correspondent from Switzerland. \"The policy in Switzerland is boring,\" I received the answer.\nA question of perspective: It is true that the Swiss elections cannot be pointed to a power struggle between two, three figures. But this is also one of the reasons that makes the Swiss system interesting for an analysis: The President or the President has little importance in Switzerland, unlike in Mexico.\nAfter the Swiss elections, Parliament will vote for the state government. It is a college of seven members who come from the strongest parties. This shows: Switzerland attaches great importance to consensus and political power is distributed over several shoulders.\nThis is perhaps also the reason why not even in Switzerland all know the names of government members and often do not know who president is. Because the Federal President or the Federal President rotates in Switzerland between the members of the government, it is above all a representative post.\nThis is also an important signal of shared political power that makes the Swiss system so different than in countries like Mexico \u2013 where politics are more like a telenovela.\n\nSwitzerland is a small and modest country. Here one believes that democracy in the Confederation is such a complicated thing that one cannot explain it to foreigners in any case.\nTherefore, there is a paradox: parliamentary elections in Switzerland \u2013 a country in the centre of Europe, a leading country in terms of economic globalisation, a country that plays the role of the financial and banking centre in the world, a country where many international organisations have their headquarters, a country with a powerful military-industrial complex \u2013 usually take place without anyone taking note of it, and the names of the leading Swiss politicians: no one say anything!\nLet's try to change something and at the same time explain why this is: The instruments of traditional representative democracy in Switzerland exist parallel to the instruments of direct democracy. The Swiss parliamentary elections do not bring much change?\nThis is because not every four years in Switzerland, but literally every day. This is due to the regular votes at all levels \u2013 federal government, cantons and municipalities.\nPerhaps the most important conclusion is that in Switzerland, a country of direct democracy, voters do not have the result of a party in parliamentary elections!\nRather, it depends on how this party works in everyday life between the elections at all levels of the federalist system: at municipal level, at cantonal level and also at federal level.\nThanks to popular initiative and referendum, the victory in the parliamentary elections in Switzerland is not a free letter for the next four years to do and to leave what and how to do it. On the day after the elections, the parties are obliged to present solutions to the people for certain problems by turning to the voters with draft laws and initiatives.\nThese initiatives will then be submitted to a referendum, and the winner or winner of yesterday can suffer a defeat in this or that question.\nThe term \"silver democracy\" has long emerged in Japan. In view of the ageing of the population and the low turnout of young people, the \"policy of the elders, of the elders and of the elders\" is put to the foreground in elections, which facilitates, facilitates, wins and implements their policies.\nAs social security costs burden state finances, reforms that reduce spending on older people are being postponed, while only the taxes and insurance premiums for young people are rising. Young people have no prospects for the future \u2013 and the birth rate continues to fall. A vicious circle.\nIn Switzerland, I take little concern from the population that democracy is developing in this direction. In this year's election campaign, the left-wing social democrats demand the development of public childcare, while the largest party, the Swiss People's Party, is clearly opposed. In the surveys on the most important topics, \"health premiums\", \"immigration\" and \"pension reform\" are on the front. The \"family policy\" is not even an option.\nWhat is the reason for this lack of interest in family policy? Is the low birth rate not an important issue for Switzerland, which at the same time attracts immigrants and immigrants looking for higher wages, a higher standard of living and a more stable political and economic climate?\nIs it not important in Switzerland, where individual political issues are decided in referendums, to send politicians: to parliament, who are oriented towards the needs of young people? These questions remain open.\nHowever, I feel that there is a risk that Switzerland will become a silver democracy. With 19.2% in 2022, the share of older people in Switzerland is lower than in Japan (29.1%).\nHowever, 26% of the persons living in Switzerland aged 18 and over are foreigners who have no voting rights. So the ageing of the actual electorate is significantly higher. It is 23.1% and is almost as high as in Japan in 2010.\nCan Swiss democracy prevent the descent into silver democracy? If so, it could be another good model for all developed countries whose society ages.\nI will still be nostalgic when I think of how I was able to vote for a parliament for the first time at 22! It wasn't the first elections in my country, Tunisia. But it was the first free, democratic and transparent elections.\nSo I did my finger joyfully in the blue electoral ink and shared the photo of it in the social media. It wasn't just an exercise in politics, it was a celebration!\nI felt the weight of this historic moment when I gave my ballot and knew that I would contribute to a democratic process in which the hopes of generations were directed before me and the hopes of my own generation. Today, where I am in Switzerland, I would like to take part in the democratic process.\nA quarter of the adult Swiss population, I too, must not vote for parliamentary elections.\nThe Federal Elections in October 2023 are approaching and\nestablished foreigners: no electoral couvert is obtained. At national level it is only possible to\nvote and vote.\nSome might say: Why should foreigners be interested in the Swiss elections? Apart from the obvious answer that I work as a journalist in Switzerland, my answer to this question goes beyond the national borders.\nThe importance of this choice and of all those who still come is noticeable in the families of immigrants: women, men and women, wherever they are. The political orientation of Switzerland, which is decided in Parliament, can shape the future of these families or even decide the fate of thousands of people \u2013 especially with regard to issues such as migration and international cooperation.\nThis is the core of Switzerland's global meaning: It is not only about domestic policy but also about the impact of this policy on the lives of people abroad.\nAlthough I am not allowed to vote at the moment, I follow the forthcoming elections up and down. Today, where I stand outside this democratic arena, I do what the excluded often do... I hope one day to participate in this democratic dance.\nIn Switzerland, parties have a fundamentally different role than what is known in China.\nAlready in the preamble of the Chinese Constitution, the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China (CCP) takes a more prominent place than \"God of the Almighty\" in the preamble of the Swiss Federal Constitution.\nWhile Article 1 of the Swiss Constitution lists the 26 cantons that together form \"the Swiss Confederation\", Article 1 of the Chinese Constitution states that the socialist system is the basic system of the People's Republic of China and the leadership of the Communist Party is the determining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics.\nThe Office of the Secretary-General of the CCP is the absolute power centre in China, while the power of Secretary-General: within the Swiss parties depends on their persuasive power in elections. The legal position of the political parties in Switzerland is rather weak.\nIt is only since 1999 that a small constitutional article (Art. 137) has been dedicated to them: \"The political parties are involved in the formation of the people's opinion and will.\" In any case, in Switzerland there is never a talk about the relationship of the state to the party in singular, but always in plural, because there are a living variety of parties. There are 11 parties in Parliament, four of them also in the government, in the Federal Council.\nIn Switzerland, the political landscape is constantly changing. The parties come and go, some merge or change their name \u2013 and of course there are also those who remain. All parties have to renew their position on the marketplace of political concepts and fight their share in the form of voters.\nThey must convince their electorate with proposals for solutions to the concerns and concerns of the population. The voters: decide \u2013 and they can be unhappy if they are dissatisfied with the performance card of a party.\nThe United States and Switzerland have a lot in common. They are both proud of their democracies and the fundamental right to vote. Increasingly, they have something else in common \u2013 growing polarization.\nIn the USA, \u201cno forum seems too small or slept to be polarized\u201d, wrote the magazine\na few years ago. In the last decade, a \u201cwe against the\u201d mentality has formed a dark cloud over the USA, which penetrates into almost all areas of life \u2013 from the halls of the capitol to the\n.\nSuch extremes seemed far away in Switzerland in the face of their system based on more than two parties and consensus: Switzerland has six main parties and a dozen smaller rings around seats in Parliament.\nBut there are signs that people in Switzerland continue to move to their different poles. Recently, a\n, that people in Switzerland fear that the population fragments into ever smaller groups that are increasingly inconsistent. As a Swiss friend told me, \"Today everything is very black and white.\"\nSome say the Coronapandemic is for Switzerland\nhad been. These have driven a new and sharper separation line between groups.\nIt is not only about individual laws and positions on subjects \u2013 different views are normal in a democratic society. Today's polarization in both countries is emotional and associated with a growing intolerance towards people with other views.\nWhile some issues of disagreement are different \u2013 for example, the abortion theme in the USA is more charged than in Switzerland \u2013 I experience in both countries that people increasingly judge the character of others because they are for or against something.\nSwitzerland has not yet reached the extreme situation in the USA, but nevertheless the growing polarisation in a country with many parties and one\ndisturbing.\nPolarization is not good for countries or democracies. It leads to people no longer talking. They remain in their echo chamber, the debate is suffocated and new ideas are no longer in the foreground.\nMore\n\nA cornerstone of democracy is blurring. Who protects freedom of expression? Our updated overview.\nShe can also completely disillusion people politically. When voters see that politicians are more involved in deepening the lines of separation rather than finding solutions, these voters are looking for: within probably elsewhere answers, retreat into their \u2018storage\u2019, the cycle continues.\nWith regard to the Federal Elections, the question of how Switzerland deals with polarising policies will send a message to the US and democracies around the world.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe election campaigns in Switzerland are not as boring as they are often accepted abroad, says historian Zo\u00e9 Kergomard.\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

Many of their tickets have long since been back to the municipality.\nBut what does it look like for the 221'448 voting foreign Swiss? Even in this electoral process, annoyed votes from all over the world reach us that the documents have not arrived or have been late.\nA brief return was no longer possible in some cases. This is no exception to other elections and votes.\nThe Fifth Switzerland feels hindered by democratic participation. A fact that regularly leads to parliamentary proposals and amendments.\nIn March of this year, the Federal Council published a report on\n, in which the various attempts to improve were analysed.\nThe sending of voting and electoral documents to the Swiss abroad is regulated at regulatory level. The material may be shipped at the earliest one week before the official dispatch in Switzerland, i.e. six weeks before the Urnengang. This year was the delivery to the Swiss: in Germany, at the earliest in the week from 11. September (Calender Week 37) allowed.\n\"The Federal Council, as in the past, has asked the cantonal governments to ensure that the electoral documents for the Swiss foreigners are sent to the Swiss foreigners before official dispatch in Germany,\" writes the Federal Chancellery on request.\nWe wanted to know from the cantons whether they were in this request and when they sent the documents to the foreign citizens.\nSuch a survey is not so easy. A total of 14 cantons lead the foreign Swiss's register of votes: both decentralised \u2013 i.e., each municipality for itself. In nine cantons, the register is run by the cantonal administration, in three cantons the responsibility lies with the administration of the cantonal capital.\nAll 26 cantons responded to SWI swissinfo.ch's request. 12 of the 14 cantons in which the municipalities are responsible for dispatch have informed the time of dispatch in the cantonal capital.\nAs a sample student among the cantons, our survey of the canton of Aargau is revealed. During the earliest possible date of dispatch to 11 September, the Canton of Aargau has already placed the documents on 8 September. September 2023 and thus sent at the end of the calendar week 36 (it was a weekend in between).\nA problem? No, Maria B\u00fchlmann, who runs the Swiss foreign register in the canton of Aargau (ZASR), is safe. She reckons from the weekend of the Urnengang, the Friday evening was in her eyes for the weekend. The Canton of Aargau thus respected the permitted six weeks before the end of the vote.\n\"We've been so busy for years that we handed the packaged documents to the mail on Friday night.\" These shipments would then have to be sorted first before shipment before the documents could be sent effectively.\n\"I make sure that the documents are not sent only during the calendar week 37,\" says B\u00fchlmann, \"but the first day.\"\nShe hopes that \"their\" foreign Swiss: inside \u2013 especially on the other side of the large pond \u2013 will give the chance to participate in the elections and votes.\nBut there is also a safety consideration behind this approach, the Aargauian ZASR leader emphasizes. \"On the Voting Rights Card are protected data.\" According to B\u00fchlmann, the postal task before the weekend is also responsible for the 3.7 tons of heavy material.\nIn the canton of Aargau there are now more than 12'500 foreign Swissmen registered: the foreign Swiss-stimmregister leader would, however, be pleased with a higher vote shareholding of \"their\" Swiss.\nEven though the documents were sent early, not all registered Swiss foreigners take part in election and voting.\nThe Aargau is one of the cantons that would like to send the electoral and voting material even earlier. According to the report of the Federal Council of March 2023, most cantons have stated that this is basically possible with them.\nHowever, this fails with the covenant. \"The multi-month process from the editorial board to the ready-to-sand pressure is already very closely clocked today,\" says the report.\nIn order to allow shipping earlier than six weeks before the election or voting day, extensive organizational procedures would have to be undertaken during the production process. \"What's not so easy for a successful system for years.\"\nBut the problem of late electoral documents does not disappear. \"These six weeks are often not enough. Overseas shipments sometimes require up to four weeks,\" says B\u00fchlmann. A punctual return is no longer possible for the Swiss abroad.\nAt the elections in 2023, the foreign citizens registered in Basel-Stadt, St. Gallen and Thurgau have: not this return problem. You are dependent on punctual shipping. However, since they can vote by e-voting this year, the deadline for return expires.\nOf the 26 cantons, 23 have sent the documents according to their own information in the course of the calendar week 37 and have therefore been in compliance with the instructions of the federal government.\nOnly the cantons Jura (3102 voting foreign Swiss:inside) and Solothurn (4195 voting foreign Swiss:inside) were able to send the voting and election material only in the calendar week 38. Why?\n\"Unfortunately there was a delay when packing, which is why shipping was only possible in calendar week 38,\" writes the deputy state writer in Solothurn, Pascale von Roll, on request.\nIn the canton of Jura, \"because of a supply problem from a part of the embassies\" it had been delayed in the distribution of documents to the municipalities. \"For this reason, the sending of the voting material for the municipalities is done until 18 September 2023,\" said the State Secretariat of the canton of Jura.\nThe exaggeration of delay is not known to the cantonal authorities. The canton of Jura is one of the 14 cantons in which the municipalities send the electoral material.\nThe documents have therefore been sent out at the earliest in the course of the calendar week 38 \u2013 i.e. over a week later than requested by the Federal Council. Valuable days that are missing from the cantons of Solothurn and Jura to participate in the elections.\nMore\n\nStable land, stable money, stable life plans: In comparison, a lot runs around Switzerland. One factor is the high confidence.\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "en_content": "Long before the result is fixed, the web portals of the Tamedia newspapers already call the election result \"historical\".\nAccording to the calculations, the right-hand conservative SVP gains clearly, while the Green Party loses similarly clearly. The Swiss media are now looking primarily at the bad result of the Greens.\nThe international media are interested in the election victory of the SVP: The conservative French newspaper writes about the victory of the SVP, which is once again the strongest party.\nthe \"populist rights\" win with topics such as the \"fight against the \"mass immigration\". The\ntitles that in Switzerland \"the populist rights envy\". At the portal\nthe \"anti-imigrant SVP\" strengthens its position as the strongest party.\nBut as historically the election day is now presented, so quiet the end of the election campaign was: In the end, the Swiss elections were hardly noticeable this year.\nThe Swiss elections are not known for large shifts \u2013 the drama is sometimes to be sought with the magnifying glass. Since the beginning of the Israeli-Palestinian war, public interest has definitely shifted to the world. Reporting on the Swiss elections might also have come to an end because in the 2023 elections, unlike four years ago, there was no outstanding campaign topic.\nThe Ann\u00e9e Politique Suisse platform also evaluates newspaper reporting according to scientific criteria in election and voting campaigns. How often did which party appear? What topic has dominated the election campaign? In 4106 newspaper articles examined for eight weeks, a wide range of topics was found: \"Krankenkasse, Gesundheit\" was most common, but also banks, transport, energy, migration and climate were present as topics, write the authors:in Anja Heidelberger and Marc B\u00fchlmann in the analysis of reporting.\nIn contrast to the 2019 elections, which are remembered as \"climate choice\" and \"women's choice\" and at the 2015 elections, where, in view of high numbers of asylum, the coverage of migration dominated everything, 2023 \"therefore, one cannot speak of a predominantly mono-thematic media election campaign coverage\".\nThe Swiss elections are mobilization choices. The deep-selection participation in international comparison ensures that the elections primarily decide which party can mobilise its existing clientele. Marc B\u00fchlmann, co-author of the study and director of Ann\u00e9e Politique Suisse, explains the interplay of media and election campaigns in conversation with SWI swissinfo.ch: \"In Switzerland with its deep turnout, the question is central in every election campaign, who manages to mobilize his clientele. When the Greens were seen four years ago by the climate movement as a problem solver, their voters have: mobilised more strongly in the world.\"\nThe party has now been less successful in taking advantage of the ongoing climate issue. For if climate policy is reported, for example, in connection with activists who stick to a road and thus block traffic, the Green Party does not help.\nThe politolog: Inside Ann\u00e9e Politique Suisse also evaluate how often the parties occur. The right-hand conservative SVP as the strongest party is most often mentioned. The social democratic SP, the liberal FDP and the moderate middle party follow.\nPrecisely accurate, the frequency of reporting corresponds to the 2019 voting shares. But the four government parties are over-represented in relation to smaller parties \u2013 most of them are under-represented by the small opposition parties PPE, EDU, MCG, Lega: \"Your voting share of 10.1% is compared to a media share of 3.4 percent,\" says the analysis.\nFor B\u00fchlmann, it is remarkable that the reporting fits as well as the voting share in 2019: \"It remains astonishing as well as the print media as a whole to reflect the prevailing conditions with regard to selectable strengths.\"\nThe parties are also present on the social media, but the Ann\u00e9e Politique director tends to be negligible. \"A large proportion of voters are middle-aged people. These do not use the social media to obtain information,\" says B\u00fchlmann. Although he acknowledges that the parties use the social media as channels for mobilization. But: \"It should be more difficult at the moment to win or convince new voters via this channel.\"\nThe platform \"Politransparency\" shows that the SP has invested with 429'100 francs most for advertising on Facebook and Instagram. Then follow the FDP, the middle party, the green liberals and the greens. The SVP invested only 112,000 francs in this field.\nNevertheless, a viral SVP video on Instagram has reached significantly more than 300'000 people \u2013 more than any other video published by a party account on Instagram.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nOur journalists give very personal answers to why the Swiss elections around the globe are interesting.\nAccording to B\u00fchlmann, however, the newspapers and traditional media remain decisive. \"It helps to get into the media, it is mobilizing,\" says B\u00fchlmann. But: \"The end would be too easy for a party to win because much is reported.\" That one is reported, but it is important \u2013 that is clearly identifiable for B\u00fchlmann. Whether this report is positive or negative, it is hardly crucial.\nThis demonstrates the responsibility of journalists: in addition to what they should report and what they do not.\nMore\n\nHow can Switzerland ensure that their citizens are not discriminated against abroad?\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

The following applies: You can only shape it when you talk. However, the average turnout is comparatively low, with around 25% each.\nThe Electorate corresponds approximately to the size of the canton of Valais, and these voters are certainly as different as the totality of all Valais. And politically as colourful as the voice in Switzerland.\nHowever, there are differences to the voters in the country, and this results from the life reality of the emigrants.\nTwo thirds live in Europe, half in Switzerland's neighbouring countries. This gives a great interest in a well-regulated relationship with the EU. They are also more open to the world, in this sense also more urban. The stranger does not scare them, on the contrary they say they live in the stranger \u2013 this has an effect on their attitude towards migration.\nBecause they live out in the world, they are also more sensitive to global trends and make them faster. This has been shown in the 2019 elections with a massive commitment to the Greens. 2023, where security, defence and power thinking dominate globally, this could also have given the bourgeois parties backwind.\nRather not every bit on social media and not every headline of the big newspapers. They usually do not receive health insurance bills or tax bills. This also forms perception. It makes fundamental questions more important than what the Swiss people encounter in everyday life.\nFirstly, according to a study, they are well educated above average. Secondly, they look at Switzerland, the strengths and weaknesses of their homeland. You will also receive comments on Switzerland, critical and admiring. It forms its consciousness.\nThey therefore have an interest in an open foreign policy and in a perceptible role in Switzerland in the world. Values such as an intact environment, a well-functioning democracy, a solidarity society: This is important to them, according to various voting analyses, and they obviously see Switzerland in the duty.\nMore\n\nHow can Switzerland ensure that their citizens are not discriminated against abroad?\nThe profile of the average foreign Swiss: according to politolog, the profile of the average foreign Swiss is markedly left and green. However, when it comes to voting, there is a more differentiated picture. There you are noticeably governmental and not only blind left-green.\nParticipation also varies: \"You are more likely to participate in the votes you are moving\", says Politologe Michael Herrman. \"Not everything has the same urgency, because not everything affects you directly. Too technical or too internal business is less moving. \u00bb\nThere are templates where the strong value orientation of this electorate appears very clearly. The Group Responsibility Initiative would have been adopted by the Fifth Switzerland, for example, with 60%; a ban on mass animal husbandry would have been accepted by the foreign Swiss: in contrast to the domestic, as well as by the two pesticide ban initiatives 2021.\nSwiss foreigners are therefore more progressive in ecological issues, while the direct effects are more important in the country, such as agriculture or consumer prices on their own wallets.\nThe following shall apply: The Swiss abroad: there are hardly any choices or votes. Experts estimate the influence of Diaspora on the votes to around 0.2 percent. So a vote would have to go so close that this Electrate could take a bit in its direction.\nBut in situations where every voice counts, they are interesting for the parties. This results on the one hand from their profile. Because they are more value-oriented, they are perhaps more loyal: once decided, the parties have good opportunities to keep the voters.\n\nSign up for our newsletter and receive swissinfo.ch's top stories directly in your mailbox.\nThe fact is, however, also: the electorate grows rapidly, it has more than tripled over the last 30 years. It now has the size to determine more than 6 to 8 seats in the National Council \u2013 theoretically, because in reality this power is fragmented to the 26 cantons.\nThe parties therefore increasingly bual the votes of the Swiss foreign ministers. SP, SVP, FDP and Mitte are already active for longer.\nThe GLP has now set up an international Swiss section for the 2023 election as the last of the big parties. This fits, because the political profile of the Swiss foreign ministers: it almost coincides with the profile of the green liberals: progressively in environmental protection, for a liberal society, and an open foreign policy.\nWhat also notices: This year, the foreign Swiss were specifically served:insides with a fair number of vacancies in Parliament \u2013 for example to health insurance companies, e-voting or Europe. Thus, in an actual election final, the parties have once again drawn attention to themselves.\nIn the community of Swiss foreigners, one sees oneself a bit like a distant relative who can give good advice from the distance and when.\nAt the urn, the Electorate shows in a certain way also \"cooler\", the nervous backlashes of domestic policy and the voting campaigns not so exposed. It also does not think first of all about its own wallet, because it hardly has to bear directly the cost consequences. A slightly more abstract view into the Swiss political company is thus taken.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nDebakel for the environmental parties, cheerful mood at the SVP. The Jojo effect has occurred.\nThis can be an enrichment for Swiss policy, in particular for foreign policy issues and for policy issues. For Swiss foreigners: inside have fine antennas, they see very accurately and quickly how Switzerland is positioned in the world.\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

In the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 as well as in the UN Act on Civil and Political Rights of 1966, Article 19 states: \"Everyone and everyone has the right to free speech; this right implies freedom to seek, receive and disseminate information and thoughts of any kind, whether oral, written or in printed form, through art or through another medium.\"\nAnd more: Article 21 states that \"each and everyone has the right to participate directly or indirectly in the government of his country\".\nIn Europe, the 1950s European Convention on Human Rights confirms freedom of expression in Article 10 as binding law. Switzerland enshrined this fundamental freedom in Article 16 of its 1999 constitution and also commits itself in Article 54, among other things to \"promoting democracy worldwide\".\nIn practice, however, a lot remains in the trench. Report presented at the end of 2022\nof \"International IDEA\" has been the number of states in which freedom of expression and democracy has been weakened over the last ten years. At the same time, the voices that are committed to fundamental freedoms and to strengthening democracy are becoming increasingly louder \u2013 as our series \"Voices of Freedom\" shows.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nFreedom of expression is a human right, and yet everything else than a matter of course.\nSocial media have become an indispensable channel for public debate. This is rarely seen as a gain in democracy. Fake News, conspiracy theories and hatred shape the picture.\nCountries around the world are trying to deal with new regulations and countermeasures. With the \"Network Implementation Act\", Germany took on a leading role worldwide.\nAnd in Taiwan a \"pro-social\" digital infrastructure has been built. In Switzerland, regulations that have been specifically adapted to social media have been lacking.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nViolence calls, conspiracy theories and censorship: The reputation of social media is on the ground. How will the Internet become a profit for democracy?\nThe decisive factor for freedom of expression is not least the division of power in a society. If many different institutions and interests can participate in the formation of opinions and no one has a monopoly on what decisions are taken, then freedom of expression can fulfil its role: strengthening democracy.\nIn the diverse and exciting debate on this, which is being held ten-language on SWI swissinfo.ch, many questions are also asked, such as the limits of freedom of expression.\nMore\nDebates\nFreedom of expression is a universal human right. But this is more and more under pressure. Also in confessed democracies. Some reasons...\nIn Switzerland, citizens in the context of direct democratic popular rights (initiative and referendum) are constantly conducting broad debates on the possibilities and limits of freedom of expression \u2013 and they are also binding on them.\nThis ridge hike in dealing with this fundamental pillar of modern democracy is challenging, but an integral part of the country's political culture. All of them are aware.\nIn 2023, several G20 countries, including India, Turkey and Indonesia, are among the countries which, according to\nhave autocratized. In these countries, not only writers are increasingly attempting to target governmental censorship measures, but also artists who, with their cartoons, try to explore the limits of the author.\nThe stress test for freedom of expression also includes the rise of illiberal populist leaders such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. However, he and other autocratic governments are now also confronting forces in his own country, which rely on a democratic discourse that goes beyond more active participation in citizens and thus more democracy.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nEight participants of the 10th World Democracy Conference in Lucerne with their vision of how democracies need to be more robust and fairer.\nIn the cross-border world of the Internet, international technology companies and national authorities are also facing each other. Both want to create at least one appearance of democracy: here is Facebook's \"independent supervisory board\" as the European Commission's data protection regulatory authority.\nThe medial pace has increased. \"For this reason, a public answer must quickly come to disinformation and hate speech,\" says Taiwanese digital minister Audrey Tang in conversation with SWI swissinfo.ch. \"If you only wait one night, people associate these viral memes with long-term memory.\"\nMore\n\n\n\n\nAudrey Tang, Taiwan's digital minister, in an interview on \"antisocial\" media and democratic competencies.\nBut not only speed is crucial, but also the character of the reaction: \"If in the same cycle \u2013 let's say within a few hours \u2013 a humorous answer can be given that encourages people to share joy and not retaliation or discrimination or revenge. Then we all feel better.\"\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "en_content": "The Ukraine war has relaunched the debate on Swiss neutrality. They believed that Switzerland had abandoned its neutrality when it joined the sanctions against Russia.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity researcher Elisabeth Hoffberger-Pippan from the German Institute for International Policy and Security in Berlin.\nIn the country, a debate on the definition and range of neutrality was still underway in the course of the Ukraine war, with two camps in principle standing opposite each other: a conservative, embodied mainly by the Swiss People's Party (SVP), which wants to adhere to a strict neutrality and plans a popular initiative with which a comprehensive neutrality would be written into the Constitution.\nOn the other hand, a more liberal camp, including a majority in government, is pushing for active neutrality.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nDid Switzerland abandon neutrality? We asked Pascale Baeriswyl, head of Switzerland's permanent mission to the UN.\nAt the end of May, Federal President Ignazio Cassis surprised with a new wording: Switzerland is following a \"cooperative neutrality\", he said at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. So he met those who asked for Russia's attack on Ukraine: can one be neutral in the face of such a war?\nHowever, in a October 2022 report, the government noted that it wanted to adhere to the previous interpretation of neutrality.\nMore\nFor a long time, Switzerland \u2013 like most neutral states \u2013 has removed from a traditional neutrality concept and turned to the community of states: since it joined the Uno in 2002, it has to follow uno sanctions.\nSwitzerland assumes that the right to neutrality is not applicable to military Uno operations, because the Security Council wants to \"restore world peace\". On the other hand, Austrian international lawyer Peter Hilpold from the University of Innsbruck says: \"Neutrality in the classical sense is hardly compatible with a UN membership and with an EU membership even less.\"\nAccording to international lawyer Elisabeth Hoffberger-Pippan from the German Institute for International Policy and Security in Berlin, the population is sometimes unaware that EU or UN membership can be accompanied by a certain dilution of neutrality.\nMore\nDebates\nThe neutrality is on the verdict of world history. Does she have a future? And how should it be defined?\n\"Switzerland has certainly not been neutral,\" says Stefanie Walter, Professor of International Relations and Political Economy at the University of Zurich. \"In the Cold War, for example, Switzerland was implicitly clear on the side of the West. She also has a position on human rights.\" In the Ukraine war, Switzerland immediately condemned the Russian attack on Ukraine as a violation of international law.\nThis leads to the question of exactly what neutrality is. When the victorious powers at the Vienna Congress granted constant neutrality in 1815 in Switzerland, the deal was: Switzerland does not participate in conflicts and does not provide mercenaries, and there are no more wars in its field.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland is looking for a new interpretation of its neutrality. The international comparison shows: neutrality has many faces.\nThere has been little change in this principle, even today, the right to neutrality is primarily committed to not participating in wars, either directly or indirectly. Neutral states must treat war-leading parties in the same way, so they must not allow over-flights on one side or provide weapons \u2013 not via third parties \u2013 and let the other go.\nIn recent months, Switzerland has banned NATO members from flying over because they supplied weapons to Ukraine. And she denied Germany and Denmark the consent of passing tanks and ammunition purchased by Switzerland to Ukraine. The pressure on Switzerland to withdraw from this strict attitude is increasing abroad.\nNeutrality is not only a legal concept, but also concerns the image of Switzerland. According to this Lesart, neutrality is the trademark of Switzerland, which it should not put into play easily. Switzerland is also trying to convince the other countries with a voluntary and flexibly adaptable \"neutrality policy\" that it would stand out in the event of a war.\nIn times of peace, Switzerland as a neutral state must not join any military alliance like Nato because it provides for mutual assistance.\nTraditionally neutral states such as Sweden and Finland have made a Nato application after the beginning of the Ukraine war, which is legally equivalent to a waiver of neutrality.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nIn neutral countries, the Ukraine war has rekindled the debate on NATO accession. We talked to a security researcher.\nFor Switzerland, on the other hand, a Nato accession is excluded, in spite of the transition of the times that the Ukraine war has been causing. It is geographically also much less exposed than the two Scandinavian countries.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nAgainst the background of the Ukraine war, Swiss calls for stronger military cooperation have become loud.\nHowever, Switzerland and Nato want to work more closely in the future, as the Swiss Defence Minister and the Nato Secretary-General agreed at a meeting at the WEF in Davos. According to a survey, this is even the case with the Swiss population for acceptance, which is behind neutrality by an overwhelming majority and is still skeptical towards a Nato accession.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nRussia's war against Ukraine leads to fundamental considerations, including the role and understanding of neutrality.\nA revolution is not accompanied by closer cooperation, because Switzerland has been looking for close proximity to its neighbours and the Nato for years, especially in training and cybersecurity. If Switzerland is attacked, it must defend itself very well together with others, it does not oppose neutrality.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe war in Ukraine gives the Swiss partnership with Nato more weight. The Swiss Head of Mission at the Alliance in an interview.\nThe less flattering tactical consideration of Switzerland is therefore: because it lies in the middle of Europe, it is not likely that a military attack against Switzerland alone will be directed. It is much more likely that several European countries will be attacked at the same time and will join forces. If Switzerland participates in the military exercises at peace times and is equipped with compatible weapons systems, it is fit to be able to fight together with Western friends in an emergency, instead of having to defend itself alone. Experts see in this context the choice of a new Swiss combat jet: the F-35 of the US manufacturer Lockheed-Martin.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland is neutral. But for years, it has been cooperating with NATO and the EU in security. Why is she doing this?\nThis attitude is often designed as a stepping stone driving abroad. Because although Switzerland wants to massively increase the army budget, it is still far from the so-called 2-percent target of the Nato. This requires members to invest 2 percent of GDP in armaments. Switzerland benefits from the Nato umbrella, without bearing the burden of a Member State, so the criticism.\nIn general, neutrality for Switzerland is of little use. It may sound paradoxical, but neutrality is a booster for weapons sales. Some countries do not want to position themselves by buying weapons from major powers such as the USA or Russia, but rather rely on the unfamiliar neutral.\nSwitzerland also benefits from neutrality as a host location and mediator, because anyone who does not position themselves can be credible as a bridge builder.\n\n\n\n\nThe foreign press has rightly classified Switzerland's sanctions as a breach of neutrality, writes SVP-National Councilor Barbara Steinemann.\nSwitzerland benefits from a special trump: \"In contrast to Ireland, Austria and Sweden, Switzerland has decided not to become a member of the European Union,\" says Walter. Switzerland is also perceived as more neutral.\nHowever, Switzerland has tried in vain for a mediator role in the Ukraine war. The plan of a protective power mandate also failed at the resistance of Moscow. Russia has not seen Switzerland as a neutral country since it has taken sanctions against the Kremlin.\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

Chiesa is convinced: \"The predicted results are an order to our party and to the whole Parliament.\" Switzerland has problems with migration, illegal migrants: inside, with large immigration and energy supply. \"The voters: inside have now clipped and clearly said what they want.\"\nThe co-party president of the Socialist Party (SP), Mattea Meyer, worries the emerging legal slip. \"Optimistically, I agree that, according to high bills, the SP can emerge from the election campaign in a stronger way,\" says Meyer.\nThat also needs to be done in order to put something to the right Parliament. The SP is expected to come to a voter: within 17.5%. She very much regrets the fall of the greens \u2013 \"we wanted and want to strengthen social and ecological Switzerland together in the future,\" says the SP Co President.\nThe President of the FDP, Thierry Burkart, is convinced that, despite the loss of 0.5 percentage points, his party has set itself to 14.6% voters: while its share of voters has been on the right and important issues in the election campaign. The security of power supply, the financing of retirement provision and our prosperity are the key issues in the next few years, but would not have caught up in the election campaign.\n\"Clar is: Migration was the big topic,\" said Burkart. This is also reflected in the SVP election result. The FDP is likely to hold its 29 seats despite forecast loss. It will be redeemed from the middle as the third largest party in Parliament.\nIn mid-President Gerhard Pfister feels a certain satisfaction, but also wants to wait for the definitive result first. \"The electoral target was 13.8% voters: inside and it looks like this is successful,\" says Pfister. The centre is expected to increase by 0.8 percentage points to 14.6%. Pfister doesn't want to catch up with the FDP. \"We tried not to look at others in our campaign.\"\nAccording to forecasts from early Sunday evening, Green Switzerland will clearly emerge as a loser from the 2023 elections. President Balthasar Gl\u00e4ttli still tries to see the positive side: \"We have historically acquired 17 seats four years ago when it comes out as it is forecast, then we can save two thirds of them,\" says Gl\u00e4ttli. The Greens lose four percentage points and thus reach a voter: within 9.2%. They are expected to lose seven seats.\nOne cannot be satisfied with this, but it is a good basis for fighting for climate protection. \"We have been accused that we have put too firmly on the issues of climate protection and that we have no answers to other issues,\" says Gl\u00e4ttli. That is what they would have had answers, but they did not put them in the centre of the campaign.\nGl\u00e4ttli admits the great defeat. However, hopes that the past legislature will not become a lost one and will therefore extend the hands for good cooperation with the other parties. \"Our offer is to seek constructive solutions,\" says the Green Party President.\n\"The end of the campaign brings something positive,\" said FDP President Burkart. It brings the chance that the parties now work together a little better in Parliament. The FDP also wants to extend the hand towards the bourgeois colleagues in the area of asylum. However, Burkart asks the SVP for willingness to compromise and the other parties to help to find solutions on the issue of migration. \"That's what kills the population.\"\nThe President of the Green Liberal Party, J\u00fcrg Gro\u00df, also sees the good at the end of the election campaign. \"Now, our task is to deal with the forthcoming legislative process,\" says Great. The GLP will commit itself to finding common solutions for Parliament.\nThe GLP, the sixth largest party in Parliament, loses 0.6 percentage points and has a new voter: within 7.2%. She's probably losing five seats. Party President Great is disappointed with the result of his party. \"But we still have chances for a stand-in in the canton of Zurich,\" big ones.\nIn the next few months, apart from asylum policy, there are many other important issues in Switzerland that would stand up, SP-Co President Meyer is convinced. Retirement, rising sickness insurance premiums, billions of motorways, limitation of rental rights \u2013 \"these are the templates we will vote on in the next few months,\" says Meyer.\nAs always after the elections, the so-called magic formula \u2013 the composition of the Federal Council \u2013 is a big topic. A topic that the Presidents of the Party do not seem to like to talk about.\nThe Federal Council dream seems to be bursting after the election result of the Greens. \"Rein arithmetic, the claim for a federal council seat is still legitimate,\" says Gl\u00e4ttli. But after this result it becomes politically difficult. The Greens would analyse the situation in the Group and discuss a possible attack on a Federal Council seat.\nThis is not a topic for the GLP either. The party of J\u00fcrg Gro\u00df has clearly missed the target of 10% voters. This and the move into the stand had been criteria for a possible claim from a Federal Council seat. It is clear, however: \"The magic formula has long been enchanted, for a long time,\" so big. The FDP and the SP are clearly overrepresented in the Federal Council. \"I still wish that we would discuss this subject more broadly.\"\nThe FDP keeps it like the middle, existing federal councils would not be selected. The composition is also not a topic for the SP at the moment. \"We have many good candidatures for the liberated seat that we can present for the election in December,\" says Meyer.\nMore\n\nHow can Switzerland ensure that their citizens are not discriminated against abroad?\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "en_content": "Anke Tresch: It is a legal slip compared to the 2019 elections. Perhaps less, however, when you look back: Between 2015 and 2019, the SVP lost twelve seats. Now she has scored nine, so not the same strength as in 2015.\nWhen you count the right camp together, FDP, SVP and the right small parties, they then had a close majority of 101 seats in the National Council. They are no longer on this result.\nBut overall, political rights against the last legislature were significantly strengthened: In the canton of Geneva, the right populist movement MCG with plus two seats has cut off very well. The Lega could stay in Ticino. And the EDU also secured a seat.\nYeah, that's true. The Greens have lost less seats than they could have suspected. But there was not only one voter transfer between the Greens and the SP \u2013 the Greens have lost five seats, the Social Democrats two added, there is something missing. The parties outside the left also lost the two seats they received in the last legislature. The left camp was weakened under the line.\nIt's hard to figure this out. But in principle, it is so that in times of global crises \u2013 when issues such as war, security, immigration and asylum are increasing in importance \u2013 the nervousness and the need for security are increasing, even in Switzerland.\nMore\n\nHow can Switzerland ensure that their citizens are not discriminated against abroad?\nAnd this traditionally strengthens the right-wing powers, especially the SVP, which has been clearly positioned on these issues for years. One has the impression that this time, especially at the SVP, the mobilisation was better than at the 2019 elections than many of their voters: they simply stayed at home in the context of climate issues. They have now been motivated back to the Urnengang, in an environment that is more in line with their own concerns and preferred topics.\nYes, there are at least in Europe, as for example the view of Germany shows, where in the past few weeks different country elections have taken place. Both the AfD and the CDU can be added. Of course, the dynamics are different because with the system of government and opposition the government parties are happy to be punished, no matter who is in power. But in principle one can see a trend: strengthening conservative forces.\nYou actually have the impression that the staff is no longer so important. With Marco Chiesa, the party has a rather pale president \u2013 yet it was able to grow strongly. They are now broader, are no longer dependent on one person, but there were several heads who successfully managed this election campaign.\nThey are mainly their main themes that they have put in the foreground loudly and have found the echo in the midst of this aussenpolitik situation. Nevertheless: In the background, Christoph Blocher continues to play a role as a lender.\nThat was one of the exciting topics in the run. It was not clear whether you can simply assemble the constituents of BDP and CVP and then come to the final result of the middle. But it worked well, the name changes and the mergers seem to have really paid off for the party.\nThe middle will probably sit in the next parliament as a royal maker, because, as I said, FDP and SVP in the National Council do not come to a majority. There will be thematic coalitions and the party will be able to choose whether and how to work with the right or the left depending on the topic. However, the middle camp (the middle, EPP and GLP) is weakened overall, as the GLP has been significantly discarded with six seat losses in the National Council.\n\nSign up for our newsletter and receive swissinfo.ch's top stories directly in your mailbox.\nIn the stand it is traditionally so that the middle and the FDP are very strongly represented. And that the SP and the SVP, the two pole parties that are strongest in the National Council, are clearly underrepresented.\nThis is due to the fact that there are major elections, so it is very important for the people who must also mobilize outside their party. This is less successful for parties taking very pronotic positions.\nAnother weakening of the SP was expected for the stand, but it does not look so bad for them now. For example, the party was surprisingly able to gain a seat in Neuch\u00e2tel.\nIn other cantons there is a second choice, the starting points are different. But under the line she could keep herself relatively good. And the SVP could also improve their representation in the stand.\nIn principle, economic policy and liberal concerns were not at the forefront of this election campaign. In this respect, the electorate did not have to position itself in relation to these issues. These questions will probably have to be renegotiated later in concrete business, in Parliament and, depending on the situation, directly in voting.\nThen you will see if this strengthening of the SVP is also reflected in these questions. But it doesn't have to be like that. In the past, the SVP has also set up elections. This, however, did not mean that it then simply marched through voting \u2013 often it did not follow the people in their socio-political issues.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nDebakel for the environmental parties, cheerful mood at the SVP, and the middle overtakes the FDP. These are the results.\nPersonally, it is a bit sad that women's representation in Parliament is coming back. This is due to the fact that the SVP has no longer portrayed women as a single party in these elections \u2013 if it wins, the proportion of women will decrease accordingly.\nThis development should be kept in mind, that was one of the great features of the 2019 elections. Equality was less important in this election campaign. Women's representation can only be achieved if parties also build and support women's candidatures \u2013 this is not an automatism\nWith regard to the Federal Council, I do not expect any changes. For a long time it has been discussed whether the Greens have a right to a seat, which remains unprecedented.\nKeep the question of the middle. According to the magic formula \u2013 if one assumes that the four strongest parties are represented in the Federal Council with two seats each for the three largest and one seat for the smallest \u2013 it would be entitled to a seat of the FDP.\nBut the middle has already said that it does not select acting federal councils, the composition of the government is probably the first. The question will probably arise only when one of the two FDP seats is released. I think she'll attack.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nWhere were the greatest changes, who made the choice, who did not? The results are interactive and in fine resolution.\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

Also in Switzerland. This global debate is a point for the future. This is nothing less than democracy, human rights, emancipation and education.\nThat is why we are convinced that this topic deserves our attention and your attention.\nTogether with you, we would like to focus on the topic of freedom of expression and encourage exchange across Swiss borders. This newsletter gives you an overview of our article series, which we have published in the past three months and which we will compile for you again. Read below or discuss with us:\nMore\nDebates\nFreedom of expression is a universal human right. But this is more and more under pressure. Also in confessed democracies. Some reasons...\nWe are aware that we send this newsletter comfortably from Switzerland. In Switzerland freedom of expression is a legally protected property. In principle, no one can be prevented from expressing their opinion. Nevertheless, it becomes obvious that the limits of free expression of opinion lie. Freedom of expression is also under pressure in other democracies.\nWe're on a critical route. Today, 68% of the world's population live in 87 countries in autocratic regimes. Read our analysis of Yanina Welp, researcher at the Albert Hirschman Centre on Democracy in Geneva. It describes the disturbing tendency that leading industrial nations of the G20 such as India or Brazil belong to those countries where democracy decreases. And it is also amazing that there is a European country at the top of autocratisation: Poland.\n\n\n\n\nFreedom of expression is at a critical path: In many countries it is threatened, and in others its borders are extinct.\nThe increase in populism is, according to Welp, a symptom of exhaustion. This comes from structural inequalities in many countries and, like a growing racism, as a valve for this inequality.\nAnother article that highlights the restrictions on freedom of expression worldwide is the focus of our democracy expert Bruno Kaufmann:\nMore\n\nA cornerstone of democracy is blurring. Who protects freedom of expression? Our updated overview.\nIn Switzerland, the Federal Council held strong interventions in fundamental rights during Corona. Switzerland, suddenly a dictatorship? The grotesque debate dominated the Polit Spring in Switzerland. Our democracy specialist Renat Kuenzi explains,\n.\nParliament transferred the emergency measures to ordinary law \u2013 the so-called Covid-19 Act. In mid-June, the Swiss voters were now able to comment. This is a globally unique direct democratic process for corona politics: well 60% endorsed the new law.\n\"In Switzerland, citizens are repeatedly making binding decisions on freedom of expression. A challenging hike\", as Bruno Kaufmann writes.\nAnd where is it currently in danger?\nNot only is the Corona pandemic a great challenge for freedom of expression: fake news, hatred and discrimination on the net.\n\nShould private companies be responsible for controlling unacceptable speech? And where are the boundaries between hate speech and free speech.\n.\nMore\n\nSign up for our newsletter and receive swissinfo.ch's top stories directly in your mailbox.\n: Around 30 non-governmental organizations warn against these legal attacks, which threaten freedom of expression in Switzerland. Samuel Jaberg reports.\n\"\n: David Eugster looks at the recent past.\n: For the first time in 2019, more people have lived under an autocratic regime for almost two decades than in a democracy, writes Claude Longchamp.\nInequality and racism are the driving force for the rise of populist leaders throughout the world. Social division threatens democracy. The standpoint from the International Geneva is entitled \"\n\".\nWithin society is intensively negotiated over the limits of the Sagable. Pros: People who had hardly one voice before will be heard. Their freedom of speech became greater, others feel that their freedom of expression was severely restricted.\n\nWhat should be said and what should not be said is increasingly triggering uncertainty in practice \u2013 and hardly anything can be instrumentalized politically as simply as this uncertainty. The \"Freedom of Thought\" like the \"Political Correction\" has long since become a political concept. This does not simplify the discussion, but splits society and creates potential for usability and radicalization.\nStay tuned, get your hearing and discuss\nwith us. For if a dominant opinion cannot be questioned, there is no democracy.\nWith cordial greetings from summer Bern,\nLarissa M.

                "en_content": "The storm on the US Capitol on the 6th January was a shock.\nFired by the elected president, a Mob tried to prevent the official confirmation of successor Joe Biden.\nThe following closures of the accounts of the selected US president by tech giants Twitter, Facebook and Youtube made clear: Control of freedom of expression has become a major issue of power.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nLarge online platforms address freedom of expression in democracies. Digital expert Martin Steiger has possible solutions.\nAt the game there is nothing less than the future of democracy, said Dirk Helbing, Professor of Computational Social Science at ETH Zurich, at the Swiss online magazine\n: \"If pluralistic civil society does not win the upper hand, it is over with democracy. We must solve our problems with an idea competition, not with violence or totalitarian measures.\"\nHow could it come? In 1996, the US Congress adopted a supplement to the so-called \"First Amendment\" of the US Constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression. \"Section 230\" (\"Section 230\") of the \"Communications Decency Act\" secures the large Tech Group immunity for all content that users publish on their online platforms. In short, it is a disclaimer of liability.\nThis opened the Pandora's box for the uninhibited publication of content of all kinds on the Internet, says Swiss tech journalist Adrienne Fichter, who specializes in network policy topics.\nIs the key to a solution \u2013 and so we are back in the present \u2013 that is, \"an amendment or deletion of this \"persilschein\"?\nYes, says American Stephen Hill, former director of the Center for Humane Technology and author. It is time for a restart, he writes in a\non the online publication Zocalo Public Square.\nThe abolition of the \"obscure law\" by the Congress did not have a perfect solution. \"But it would make Big Tech Media more responsible, thoughtful and potentially liable for the worst of their toxic content, including illegal content such as child pornography,\" said Hill.\nHe pleads that the U.S. government takes the digital group to the Kandare, as it had done with the telephone, railway and energy companies. In concrete terms, he calls for the following steps:\nThis is exactly where Marietje Schaake sees need for action.\n\"Tech companies are too powerful, especially the handful of huge players who run social media platforms and search engines,\" says the President of the Cyber Peace Institute in Geneva and Director of International Politics at Stanford University's Cyber Policy Center.\nSWI #Freedom of Thought Series\nIn principle, everything should be clear. Both in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and in the UN Act on Civil and Political Rights (1966), Article 19 states: \"Everyone and everyone has the right to free expression of opinion; this right implies freedom to seek, receive and disseminate information and thoughts of any kind, whether oral, written or printed, by art or by another medium of its choice.\"\nIn Europe, the European Human Rights Convention (1950) confirms freedom of expression as legally binding law (Article 10). Switzerland anchors this fundamental freedom in Article 16 of its 1999 constitution.\nIn practice, however, much remains controversial. Governments around the world do not protect the right to freedom of expression, but increasingly undermine it. In other parts of the world, individuals and groups use the term \"freedom of opinion\" to justify discriminatory and hateful externalities. But although it is a universal right, freedom of expression is not an absolute right. To ensure and apply them is always a ridge hike.\nIn a new series, SWI swissinfo.ch deals with these different aspects, challenges, opinions and developments relating to freedom of expression \u2013 both in Switzerland and worldwide.\nWe offer a platform for citizens to look at the topic, provide analyses from renowned scientists and illuminate developments at local and global level. And of course, readers are invited to participate in the discussion and raise their voice this spring.\n\"They are not only able to move masses of consumers, but also masses of voters. This power must now be addressed,\" says Schaake\n*. The Dutch also advocates regulation analogous to that of banks, pharmaceutical companies or the automotive industry.\n\"On the one hand, it takes clear commitments and standards from companies. On the other hand, serious sanctions must be imposed on violations of supervisory bodies and regulatory authorities. These bodies must have both the know-how and the power and the capacity to carry out such measures and to investigate what is going on.\"\nUnlike Hill holds Claire Wardle from\n, a global initiative against disinformation, not much of a deletion of paragraphs with the exclusion of liability. \"Without such protection, platforms could be forced to remove both true and false information,\" says Wardle to SWI swissinfo.ch. \"Instead of focusing on the elimination of false information, we should think more about why people even publish and disseminate such.\"\nAccording to Wardle, the state should promote a \"heavy news environment\" by supporting local providers. \"As local news providers are dying, more and more people are in the social media to provide messages there.\"\nWardle considers a global solution to be possible. \"The UN has set standards to protect freedom of expression, on which many platforms are oriented. Thus, a mechanism for global corporate accountability could also be possible.\"\nAt the end of 2020, the European Commission \u2013 the EU executive \u2013 has presented the \"Digital Services Act\" with which the global tech giants are to become more responsible. The principle of the draft: What is prohibited in the real world should also be in cyberspace bans.\nFor digital specialist Adrienne Fichter, this focuses on a innovation: \"The law bred a uniform action along defined and institutional procedures. With points of contact, binding deadlines and the possibility of proceeding to state courts.\"\nFichter points out, however, that Google has already announced bitter resistance to the regulatory plan.\nIn fact, they saw themselves confronted with the conquered resistance of 27 states. In addition, according to the hope of Brussels, the EU regulatory framework would be the new benchmark that other countries would have to follow.\nLike most countries, the Swiss government has so far set on self-regulation. But there's also something in Bundesbern. \"The Federal Administration is currently declaring how a Swiss governance approach is necessary and possible with regard to online platforms,\" writes the Federal Office for Communication (Bakom) on request from SWI swissinfo.ch.\nBased on a 2019 report, the authorities were now currently examining how the use of artificial intelligence or algorithms by search engines or social media would influence public opinion and will formation. However, the publication of the corresponding report should be expected at the earliest at the end of this year, according to the Bakom.\nThe Swiss authorities would closely monitor the legislative process in the EU in the field of digital services. However, it is too early to assess how relevant the regulation proposed by Brussels could be for Switzerland.\nAfter all, the Bakom reveals so much: in the forthcoming report, not \"in the first place, the need to align Swiss law with EU law, but a Swiss governance approach\" would be examined.\nMovement also exists in the Swiss Parliament. National Council of Balthasar Gl\u00e4ttli submitted a motion that calls for an international online platform in Switzerland. \"My advance would be relevant to Swiss people who feel that they are illegally locked, but they do not pass on via the usual reporting mechanisms online,\" says Gl\u00e4ttli.\nThis was also true for people from Switzerland who want to fight against racist vaccinations or personal injury.\nFor Martin Steiger, a specialist in law in digital space, Gl\u00e4ttlis's proposal goes in the right direction, as it is in a\nwith swissinfo.ch said, \"If you had such a 'letter box' here, affected people could get hurt faster.\" National and postulate have adopted the motion, now the Federal Council is on the train.\nGl\u00e4ttlis Ratskollege Jon Pult asks the Federal Council to provide information on political advertising on the Internet in an advance of last December. He also wants to know whether the government sees any need for regulation of personalised campaigns.\nArticles in this story\nSet voices of freedom from all over the world\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

Doch: \"Unter Umst\u00e4nden reagieren manche Menschen dann eben gegenteilig: Sie sehen eine Diktatur am Werk und weigern sich, die Massnahmen einzuhalten.\" Diese Menschen f\u00fchlten sich bevormundet, widersetzten sich und versuchten, ihre Autonomie wiederherzustellen.",
                    "Die Forschungsresultate von Urte Scholz zeigen: Positive Strategien sozialer Kontrolle w\u00e4re auch w\u00e4hrend der Pandemie w\u00fcnschenswert.

                    "Sind solche Versuche nicht naiv und zum Scheitern verurteilt? \"Ob das Gegen\u00fcber auf ein solches Angebot eingeht, h\u00e4ngt stark vom sozialen Kontext ab\", sagt Scholz.

                "en_content": "\"Freedom of expression protects a fundamental need for people,\" says Maya Hertig, professor of Swiss and European constitutional law at the University of Geneva. The idea of freedom of expression is based on the enlightened concept that we are all thinking, reasonable beings that form their opinion in dialogue.\n\"Freedom of expression and freedom of information are essential for democracy,\" says Hertig. The same applies to research: \"Progress is only possible if the prevailing opinion can be challenged.\"\nSWI #Freedom of Thought Series\nIn principle, everything should be clear. Both in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and in the UN Act on Civil and Political Rights (1966), Article 19 states: \"Everyone and everyone has the right to free expression of opinion; this right implies freedom to seek, receive and disseminate information and thoughts of any kind, whether oral, written or printed, by art or by another medium of its choice.\"\nIn Europe, the European Human Rights Convention (1950) confirms freedom of expression as legally binding law (Article 10). Switzerland anchors this fundamental freedom in Article 16 of its 1999 constitution.\nIn practice, however, much remains controversial. Governments around the world do not protect the right to freedom of expression, but increasingly undermine it. In other parts of the world, individuals and groups use the term \"freedom of opinion\" to justify discriminatory and hateful externalities. But although it is a universal right, freedom of expression is not an absolute right. To ensure and apply them is always a ridge hike.\nIn a new series, SWI swissinfo.ch deals with these different aspects, challenges, opinions and developments relating to freedom of expression \u2013 both in Switzerland and worldwide.\nWe offer a platform for citizens to look at the topic, provide analyses from renowned scientists and illuminate developments at local and global level. And of course, readers are invited to participate in the discussion and raise their voice this spring.\nThat is why freedom of expression is a human right. It is anchored, inter alia, in Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and in Article 19 of the UN Act on Civil and Political Rights.\nIn Switzerland, the right to freedom of expression was enshrined only in the 1999 Constitution \u2013 but since 1959 as\n.\nis a senior editor of\n, the first independent online magazine for knowledge in Switzerland. Prior to this she had written for the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung for six years and was on the move as a reporter, including in Myanmar.\nAccording to the constitutional author Hertig, freedom of expression protects both appearances of verifiable facts and subjective opinions and emotions \u2013 for example in art \u2013 and symbolic actions \u2013 for example in the form of a seat strike. \"The entire communication process is protected, from spreading to receiving,\" she says. In principle, no one from the state must be prevented from expressing his opinion.\n\"The right to have an opinion is not divisible,\" she explains. So it is not criminal to have a racist attitude. To spread racist appearances, on the other hand.\nBecause the freedom of expression is also limited by law. \"Freedom to express an opinion is not absolute,\" says Hertig. An absolute right is one that can never be restricted \u2013 even in exceptional circumstances such as war, crisis or pandemic. \"There are only a few absolute rights that apply unrestrictedly, for example the ban on torture.\" Torture is never allowed, neither in war nor in peace, nor if the information that one hopes to obtain through torture could protect many lives.\nFreedom of expression ends where other protected goods such as human dignity are violated. This shall apply to:\nlike the Holocaust. But also, for example, the spread of hatred against individual persons or groups of persons is punishable.\nDuring the Corona pandemic, cases have evolved in which large Internet portals such as Youtube canceled contributions due to false statements. Is that a restriction of freedom of expression? Theoretically, so Hertig. But: \"Freedom of expression only protects against interference by the state, it does not directly bind private actors like Youtube.\" With regard to freedom of expression it is therefore only possible to appeal against the State, not against private persons.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nDemocracy vs. Facebook & Co.: The great debate in the USA, Europe and Switzerland about the taming of tech giants.\nThe prohibition of censorship is also primarily directed against the state. Youtube and other channels are private providers that are not directly bound to the constitutional censorship ban. So they are free tolerate what they want on their platform \u2013 and what they don't.\nOnly: \"The State must take appropriate measures to protect freedom of expression against private restrictions,\" says Hertig. This is also true on the Internet and there some platforms now have a monopoly: \"Youtube and other social media are essential today so that citizens can get into a debate.\"\nHowever, the protection of freedom of expression in the network is difficult to provide because companies are often located abroad and unilateral government regulations lead to legal fragmentation. Therefore, more uniform international rules and more transparency are urgent, says Hertig. \"It must be clear what's going on.\" This can also be done through supranational initiatives. For example, large IT companies, including Facebook and Youtube, have a\nto check reports of hate speech within 24 hours. In addition,\nin dealing with desinformation. This is only a matter of\nthe company, so self-regulation.\nHowever, the constitutional author Hertig does not hold any laws that require the deletion of false messages. Legally, it is not generally forbidden to spread false facts. It is also sometimes difficult to define what the \"truth\" is. And in some Asian countries, for example, under the pretext of Fake News, state censorship is being operated. \"It is a part of a democracy that unloved content is also visible,\" she says.\n\"The more diverse the opinion picture, the better it is for democracy,\" says Florian Steger, medical ethicist and director of the Institute for History, Theory and Ethics of Medicine at Ulm University. Listening is a necessary act of the democratic process. A real solution to the problem of false information is not erasing anyway, because \"the opinion remains in the minds\".\nAccording to Steger, citizens' dialogue and transparent communication would be much better. \"Just in a pandemic like this, the evidence base is often inadequate and governments must act out of caution.\" These gaps in knowledge should be mentioned \u2013 even if ignorance is difficult to bear for many people.\nIf posts were deleted, says Steger, it will be quite generally dangerous. \"You can only delete what erodes the state inside. Police and courts are responsible for such deletions.\" Concretely, if the core cells of democracy are threatened with violence, as in the case of the storm on the US Capitol, then the limit of the Sagable is reached.\nCertain critics of the Corona protection measures complain that they are annoyed by their opinion or referred to as \"Corona deniers\" and therefore freedom of expression is exalted. Maya Hertig says: \"Whoever expresses a controversial opinion must also withstand the undermined opinions of the opposite side. It's part of it that you're attacked rhetorically. There is no right not to be criticized.\"\nAnother argument of \"Corona sceptics\": There is a social climate in which no different opinion can be expressed. For example, the web portal Rubikon, which is close to conspiracy theories, writes: \"Request once, in the circle of friends and families, the danger of Covid-19 to deny\". Try to question the meaning and purpose of inoculation. It may be that you reap so aggressively that next time you prefer to remain silent.\" To think differently, socially-attended and freedom of expression is thus de facto not possible.\n\"Freedom of opinion naturally needs a certain social climate,\" says Hertig. \"If there is a climate that leads to self-censorship, this is a problem.\" These include violence and threats, dismissals, and also vehement verbal attacks on others.\n\"Shitstorms\" can also represent a problem according to Hertig. Only those who take the aggressive part often see themselves as victims: \"The social pressure is exaggerated to 'political correctness' and this leads to a victim-taker reversal: the victim is the white racist, not the black one faced with hate speech.\"\nThreats against scientists have increased during the pandemic \u2013 by violence and threats against corona sceptics, nothing can be felt at least in Switzerland. Each and everyone can freely express their opinion and participate in corona demonstrations.\nBut whether the social environment of the rebels brings joys is another question. \"If Corona sceptics feel restricted to saying something, it is often not limited to freedom of expression, but social control,\" says Urte Scholz, Professor of Applied Social and Health Psychology at the University of Zurich.\nSo, if some \"corona sceptics\" see freedom of expression threatened, they can mean at most the social pressure that makes it difficult to express a different opinion.\nWith social control, people try to move their fellow human beings to a certain behavior. \"Social control basically takes place whether we want it or not,\" Scholz explains. \"In a social relationship, it happens because we react.\" And especially in a pandemic, social control can be more common because it is legitimated by official behaviour recommendations and rules.\nHowever, there are different ways to exercise social control. Some lead to positive feelings, others to negative ones. Thus it comes to shame or anger through punishment, nails, deprivation of love or friendship or by creating a bad conscience with the \"controlled\" persons.\nIn studies on social control in relation to the health behaviour of couples, Scholz and her team found that these negative strategies do not bring. They could not establish a link between \"negative\" social control and healthier behavior. On the contrary, the controlled persons often did not exactly what their partners expected \u2013 either demonstrative or secret.\nIn contrast, those who were confronted with positive strategies of social control reacted. Positive strategies include discussing, negotiating, persuading, highlighting the benefits of the desired behaviour, referring to positive examples and compliments. If the partner exercised such positively experienced social control, the \"controlled\" people changed their behaviour rather and felt better.\nNegative social control, such as is presently present in the public, for example, due to nasty gazes or disguise, is not uncommon in a pandemic. But: \"In some circumstances, some people react in opposite ways: they see a dictatorship at work and refuse to comply with the measures.\" These people felt guarded, resisted and tried to restore their autonomy.\nUrte Scholz's research results show that positive strategies for social control would also be desirable during the pandemic. This is what we are talking about: with critics of protection measures, exchange, allow other opinions and do not want to change a behaviour about pressure or negative emotions.\nIf someone sits in the tram without a mask, you could say, \"It would be important for me to wear a mask because I feel more comfortable.\" Or, \"You must have forgotten the mask, it has already happened to me.\" Or offer the other a fresh mask.\nAre such attempts not naive and condemned to fail? \"Whether it comes to such an offer depends heavily on the social context,\" says Scholz. But it is worth an attempt \u2013 and in all, better than simply calling it an \"idiot\".\nArticles in this story\nSet voices of freedom from all over the world\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

Much more, they are perceived as a carrier of fake news, conspiracy theories and hate messages. In 2017, the Federal Council in Switzerland came to the conclusion: \"No new regulatory requirements for social media.\" At the same time, the fears that private tech companies exert too much power with them and make unpleasant voices disappear.\nSWI #Freedom of Thought Series\nIn principle, everything should be clear. Both in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and in the UN Act on Civil and Political Rights (1966), Article 19 states: \"Everyone and everyone has the right to free expression of opinion; this right implies freedom to seek, receive and disseminate information and thoughts of any kind, whether oral, written or printed, by art or by another medium of its choice.\"\nIn Europe, the European Human Rights Convention (1950) confirms freedom of expression as legally binding law (Article 10). Switzerland anchors this fundamental freedom in Article 16 of its 1999 constitution.\nIn practice, however, much remains controversial. Governments around the world do not protect the right to freedom of expression, but increasingly undermine it. In other parts of the world, individuals and groups use the term \"freedom of opinion\" to justify discriminatory and hateful externalities. But although it is a universal right, freedom of expression is not an absolute right. To ensure and apply them is always a ridge hike.\nIn a new series, SWI swissinfo.ch deals with these different aspects, challenges, opinions and developments relating to freedom of expression \u2013 both in Switzerland and worldwide.\nWe offer a platform for citizens to look at the topic, provide analyses from renowned scientists and illuminate developments at local and global level. And of course, readers are invited to participate in the discussion and raise their voice this spring.\n\"These companies have enormous power. You have too much power, especially the huge players, the social media platforms and search engine operators. They are able to move not only masses of consumers, but also masses of voters. This is becoming increasingly clear and this power must now be addressed,\" warns cyber expert Marietje Schaake in Interwiew with SWI swissinfo.ch against the dangers of unregulated social media.\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\"In the USA, we see where lies and the apron of hatred and violence actually lead in the net\" \u2013 Interview with Marietje Schaake.\nWhat would have to happen so that social exchange on the Internet is again regarded as a profit for democracy? Who can stop polarisation \u2013 and how? Politics by creating laws? The tech companies by giving themselves rules? Or civil society by sanctioning what you don't care?\nEspecially in society, many experts see the solution. The change must be thought of from below, from the user's side, argues about Taiwan's digital minister Audrey Tang. You could say: Change must be democratic.\nHowever, many countries try to deal with the problems with new laws and regulations. Germany took on a leading role with the \"Network Implementation Act\" (NetzDG). This law affects all platforms with more than two million users in Germany. You must ensure that complaints are carefully examined and all illegal content removed within 24 hours. In 2019, Facebook had to pay a penalty of 2 million euros because it did not comply with these requirements.\nThe German law is an export success: scientists from the Danish think tank Justitia represented a total of 25 countries that discussed or implemented laws inspired by the NetzDG by October 2020.\nThe problem: The basic idea of the German model can easily be abused by less democratic governments. The Danish researchers note in their report that the \"Network Investigation Act\" contains legal guarantees and protection of the free expression of opinion, which were not equally adopted by all countries.\nWith its new rules, India wants to ban content that threatens the \"unity, integrity, defence, security and sovereignty of India\" \u2013 a formulation that seems to be created to bring unloved voices to tumult.\nRussia also explicitly refers to the example of NetzDG in regulations against fake news. In addition, the legal framework was created in 2020 so that the Internet can be completely paralyzed in an undefined \"emergency case\".\nWhat for some is the fight against hatred serves others for censorship. For Petra Grimm, Professor of Digital Ethics at the Stuttgart University of Media, it is clear that freedom of expression is always linked to certain barriers, as freedom in principle.\"\nIn Poland, confrontation follows a long-lasting dispute between Facebook and politicians from the government party, who have repeatedly spread anti-LGBT messages in social media and have therefore been banished by the platform.\nWhile most countries are concerned with preventing dangerous or unpopular content on the Internet, Poland and Hungary are pursuing a different approach: they want to prevent Facebook and Co. from blocking user profiles as long as the mails do not break domestic law.\nHungary's Minister of Justice reads in February (on Facebook), the big social media wanted to \"restrict the visibility of Christian, conservative, right-wing opinions\".\nIn Switzerland, regulations specifically adapted to social media have been lacking. Network activist Jolanda Spiess-Hegglin, who fights against hatred in the net with the organization Netzcourage, sees need for action. She says, \"A federal councilwoman should decide: Now we call a working group and work out a Hate-Speech law.\"\nIt is too easy to get away with discriminatory or malicious calls, for example by saying that one has been hacked or someone else has been behind the computer.\nethic Grimm, in turn, emphasizes not only the policy is in duty: \"It is also a responsibility of tech companies, a responsibility for self-control.\"\nIn some countries, Facebook or Twitter are now calling for clearer regulations. Spiess-Hegglin doesn't believe this: \"If companies demand clearer rules from the state, it's like a murderer would say: 'You don't have to sell me a knife, otherwise I'm dying!'\"\nCommercial social platforms will hardly change significantly. The basic problem is structural, says Grimm: \"News that are very spectacular, that go beyond the truth or heat the minds above all are particularly often clicked. And clicks are of course the business of social media.\" Spiess-Hegglin summarizes this: \"The social media allow hate speech because it brings clicks and money.\"\nWhat's the way out? \"An alternative social network that works according to the principles of public understanding requires communication without commercial exploitation,\" says Grimm.\nWhat the professor is doing already exists. For example, in Taiwan: The platform PTT, often described as the Reddit Taiwan, is funded by the National University, regardless of advertising money or shareholders.\nAudrey Tang, Taiwan's digital minister, presents this system in an interview with SWI swissinfo.ch to the commercial providers, which it calls \"anti-social\" media, as a more socially valuable example.\nIn order for the social media to change for the better, pressure must come from society, explains Tang. One example: In Taiwan, civil society successfully demanded more transparency in politics. \"This hard-fighted, radical transparency regarding political campaign financing has become a norm.\" In Taiwan, it now also bends Facebook and exposes political advertising in real time: \"We have not introduced a law for this. It is based solely on social sanctions.\"\nMore\n\n\n\n\nAudrey Tang, Taiwan's digital minister, in an interview on \"antisocial\" media and democratic competencies.\nAlso in direct exchange with one another there must be a rethinking, Spiess-Hegglin is convinced: \"We need to learn to maintain a communication that does not distinguish.\" She notes: \"The social media are basically a gift, especially for activists who are hardly heard in traditional media.\"\n\"It is about building a virtue culture of social media from the user side,\" Grimm is convinced. \"We need a new narrative. This narrative should be more optimistic and value-oriented.\" It needs efforts with political support to create alternatives to commercial tech giants. \"That would have to be at least European\" \u2013 Switzerland is there.\nAt the moment, however, a European regulation is not the focus of the Swiss authorities. Although the Federal Office for Communication examines possible governance approaches for online platforms, it seeks its own Swiss solution. Matthias Ammann from the liberal think tank Avenir Suisse prefers to rely on the verdict of the enlightened citizens rather than on regulations. Finally they also trust them with the direct democracy of Switzerland, he writes in the\n.\nArticles in this story\nSet voices of freedom from all over the world\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

At the latest since the small island state has mastered the pandemic as well as hardly any other country, Tang is omnipresent in international media.\nSWI #Freedom of Thought Series\nIn principle, everything should be clear. Both in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and in the UN Act on Civil and Political Rights (1966), Article 19 states: \"Everyone and everyone has the right to free expression of opinion; this right implies freedom to seek, receive and disseminate information and thoughts of any kind, whether oral, written or printed, by art or by another medium of its choice.\"\nIn Europe, the European Human Rights Convention (1950) confirms freedom of expression as legally binding law (Article 10). Switzerland anchors this fundamental freedom in Article 16 of its 1999 constitution.\nIn practice, however, much remains controversial. Governments around the world do not protect the right to freedom of expression, but increasingly undermine it. In other parts of the world, individuals and groups use the term \"freedom of opinion\" to justify discriminatory and hateful externalities. But although it is a universal right, freedom of expression is not an absolute right. To ensure and apply them is always a ridge hike.\nIn a new series, SWI swissinfo.ch deals with these different aspects, challenges, opinions and developments relating to freedom of expression \u2013 both in Switzerland and worldwide.\nWe offer a platform for citizens to look at the topic, provide analyses from renowned scientists and illuminate developments at local and global level. And of course, readers are invited to participate in the discussion and raise their voice this spring.\nShe does not work for the government, but with the government, she says in the\n. It is not a large ministry with budgets and employees, but a direct link between the government and the electorate, activists and activists.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nViolence calls, conspiracy theories and censorship: The reputation of social media is on the ground. How will the Internet become a profit for democracy?\nChina still sees the state with 23 million inhabitants as part of the Chinese territory. Only a few countries maintain official diplomatic relations with Taiwan \u2013 Switzerland is not part of it. Under this pressure, Taiwan turned into a flagship democracy: In the latest democracy ranking of the magazine The Economist, Taiwan is placed just before Switzerland. Innovative forms of online participation play an important role.\nAudrey Tang: I do not often think in the categories of optimism and pessimism. I think in the categories of pro-social, civil society infrastructure, unlike an anti-social, rather private infrastructure.\nSocial media, antisocial or prosocial, can remain social. Just as we have meeting places of people who speak in a city hall, in a public debate in a park, structured around politics in an academic environment. These are public infrastructures.\nYou can also talk about politics in a loud bar, in a nightclub where people have to scream to be heard, with addictive drinks, private doorkeepers and so on. This is also a talk about politics, but perhaps not necessarily a prosocial one.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland is \"world champion\" in analogue direct democracy. Taiwan is the world's leading point of digital, participatory democracy.\nAs with these physical spaces, we also have different configurations of social interaction in the digital space. In Taiwan, the sunflower movement has created our own communication infrastructure, in a way that is often referred to as \"situational application\".\nThis allows us to program the digital spaces themselves when a need for communication arises. We do not adapt to the rather unsocial side of social media. We can shape the interaction as the participants want. This has been the case here in Taiwan for a while, for 25 years.\nThe town hall isn't just a house, is it? The town hall is a system of standards, as you speak and listen alternately. These standards are important. The Taiwanese idea of democracy as a form of technology captures this standard very well. People do not just report to protest when they think something is wrong with the existing democratic process.\nThey also report to show how things could work better. So you\u2019ll also design how we can try different software layouts or designs from public parks.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe island is a democracy newcomer. But in digital democracy they are world class. We say why.\nI would like to point out that in the last century one has often said: \"One must be formed to participate in democracy.\" Nowadays we say, \"You must have competence to participate in digital democracy.\"\nThe difference between competence and education is that education is about receiving. Competence is about shaping.\nInstead of telling the very young people: \"You must be an adult to participate in democracy,\" we say, \"No, go ahead and start your citizens' initiatives.\" More than a quarter of citizens' initiatives are digital democracies that are launched by people younger than 18 and are also very effective, such as the ban on plastic straws in our national drink, the Bubble Tea.\nThe focus is on lifelong learning, solidarity between generations, mutual mentoring. We want to guarantee that all young people can determine the agenda so that they feel involved in democracy even before they grow up.\nIf they are prepared to act pro-socially, many of their existing infrastructures could be positive. However, if they do not work in a pro-social way, they know that they have to expect social sanctions in Taiwan.\nIf people already have a firm idea of what is considered to be a standard, the multinational media companies that have failed to comply with the standard will have great difficulties in getting through.\nIf society fails to have an established social standard, for example in the field of transparency in electoral campaign financing, then social media can, of course, completely ignore the state.\nIn Taiwan, civil society literally occupied Parliament and called for transparency. It has been moved to the National Audit Office, has collected the reports on the electoral issue and scanned them for machine-readable data.\nThis hard-fighted, radical transparency regarding political campaign financing has become the norm. For this reason, Facebook cannot refuse to convert the political advertisements in real time into publicly available data. Foreign interference or financing is prohibited, similar to that of both campaign financing.\nWe have not introduced a law. It is based solely on social sanctions.\nYes, among the factual examiners there are many pupils. This is also part of the competence.\nPeople can mark content for a \"Gegen-Infodemie-Tool\" such as Line.\nIf something is marked, the dashboard shows on the line platform, which is currently in the trend without saying whether it is disinformation, fraud, hate speech or something else. Very neutral, as if these messages would go viral.\nWhat is viral is not necessarily toxic. However, if this is the case, early recognition allows us to deal with this: that humour acts better than the rumor \u2013 humor over rumor. If you only wait one night, people associate these viral memes with long-term memory.\nIf within a few hours we roll out a comic response to toxic content, it motivates people to share joy and not retaliation or discrimination or revenge. You feel better. But the key is the timely reaction. In the net, the best plans do not work if you wait a few days.\nArticles in this story\nSet voices of freedom from all over the world\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "en_content": "The Uno Special Rapporteur Irene Khan criticises Switzerland for the violation of press freedom, in the ranking of \"reporters without borders\" the country has slipped away and otherwise there are negative presses on media freedom.\nWhat's going on? We talked to the lawyer, investigative journalist and chief director of a well-known Swiss news and consumer magazine, Dominique Strebel.\nDominique Strebel is a lawyer and journalist. He worked as a SRF federal court correspondent, editor of journals Observer and pleading, as a journalist at \"NZ on Sunday\", \"Tages-Anzeiger\" and the Republic. Today he is the head of the news and consumer magazine Observer, blogger, media lawyer, research coach and lecturer at the Swiss Journalist School MAZ.\nDominique Strebel: I have the feeling that Switzerland has built a protective wall around the banking and financial industries against unpopular research.\nIn 2015, two laws were introduced with a similar\nsupplemented by the fact that cooperation in a search for information under the banking secrecy has already been declared criminal.\nSource protection in Switzerland also has a heavy impact on the financial and banking industry: not only in the case of murder and death, media professionals must award their source, but also in money laundering. Any source providing information on money laundering must therefore be expected that a journalist or a journalist must disclose their name to the prosecutor's office if the information is under the banking secrecy.\nThis shows that the banking and financial industry \u2013 or parliament \u2013 misses a muzzle in Switzerland.\nI do not have an overview of all countries. But the handling of whistleblowers, for example, is a different one in the Anglo-Saxon area than in Switzerland, which are sometimes even reconciled when they make information public.\nAnd in Germany there is no such rule as in Swiss banking law that the disclosure of information under the banking secrecy is criminal. This was shown in the searches for Suisse Secrets, where German journalists could do this work and the Swiss weren't doing it because they were criminal.\nIn February 2022, media in an international cooperation based on corporate bank data made public that the Swiss Grossbank Credit Suisse has helped decades of criminals and dictators hide their money. More information\n, which fights against corruption among others.\nIn the Swiss Criminal Code an article is missing, according to which the safeguarding of legitimate public interests similar to emergency or emergency can be a justification ground. This leads to cases such as that of a local journalist who was sentenced to first and second instance because she had entered an occupied house for a report. She was only acquitted by the federal court \u2013 but because of a lack of intention. A classic way out with a striking result. But unsatisfactory for journalism because the signal remains: does not research on occupied land.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nFor years, the Grossbank CS should have had controversial leaders and corrupt officials as customers, says an international search network.\nAt the moment such a justification is provided only for individual facts. The dishes sometimes fill the gap, but are very reserved. They would have to deal with the balance between media freedom and prosecution interest today. However, various new judgments by the European Court of Human Rights show that Swiss courts do so inadequately.\nIf, in general, part of the Criminal Code there were such an article, journalists could argue in court that the offence of bank secrecy was fulfilled, but their action was justified because they acted in public interest. The courts would then have to consider in individual cases the justification for the safeguarding of legitimate public interests, and would not only do so incompletely and withholding if they weigh between media freedom and law enforcement interests. This is what Uno's special rapporteur Irene Khan demands from Switzerland.\n(laughs) I think that's exaggerated. What gives me thought: The federal court is very restrictive, especially at the level of research techniques. We have to fight our freedom of media again and again in Strassburg before the European Court of Human Rights.\nAn example of source protection: A journalist from Basler Zeitung reported about a cannabis dealer. The Prosecutor's Office then asked her to announce the name of this trader, because in Swiss law there is an exception to the protection of sources in drug trafficking if a profit of more than 10,000 francs is achieved. Only the court in Strassburg was right to the journalist and said that it was not human rights compliant to prevent media workers from protecting their sources. The prosecution interest in such a case does not justify the intervention in media freedom.\nAlso at the hidden camera, Strassburg has whipped back the Swiss federal court. We are currently waiting for a verdict when storing data. Specifically, it is about the law enforcement authorities having insights into mobile radio data from media professionals for six months. So you see who had contact with whom, which digitally undermines source protection.\nIn the field of research, the Swiss courts distrust important research methods, which are now scorching certain principles such as trust and faith, but are necessary. Say whistleblower, hidden camera and hidden research, as dishes in Switzerland have inhibitions, which means that Strassburg has to intervene repeatedly correctively.\nI don't know if it's a mentality question, probably a legal tradition. Previously, the courts were also very restrictive as regards the issue of secret documents from the administration. The state is trapped in itself because he wants to keep information about his own activity secret.\nMore\n\nStable land, stable money, stable life plans: In comparison, a lot runs around Switzerland. One factor is the high confidence.\nIt has something paternalistic. One has the feeling that the journalist may not get into his hands. You do not trust the journalist that they can judge themselves whether they can publish something or not. And you do not trust your own legislation \u2013 that is, the protection of criminal and civil rights and the protection against unfair competition is sufficient.\nOn the one hand, I am often faced with requests for deletion. So people are calling on their personal rights, in particular on the right to forget. It is sometimes necessary to make it clear that an article is right to stay online for a certain period of time, including name naming. For example, if someone has committed a failure to warn people, there is a public interest.\nI am aware that the eternal availability of texts is a quantum leap compared to earlier, when you had to get to the archive to read an article. How to maintain personality rights without hindering journalistic work, this is still an open question and I am experiencing challenges.\nSo I am most often experiencing deletion requests, followed by counter-representation requests. And you have to think about when you call a name. You have to consider each decision whether it is in court.\nI don't feel that way, at least not in comparison with Germany and Austria. In the Anglo-Saxon area, however, personality rights and data protection are less pronounced. This has a long tradition. There I can also simply approach files of criminal proceedings in which the names of the parties are mentioned. In this respect, Swiss courts are very restrictive \u2013 in my opinion too restrictive.\n\nSign up for our newsletter and receive swissinfo.ch's top stories directly in your mailbox.\nI think it's the practice. But, of course, media professionals are too flexible with regard to a possible procedural consequences. It also has to do with the fear that things can't be documented or untruthed. You want to secure yourself by giving a quotation or a part of the content to read back.\nThere is hardly any concrete criminal proceedings on the right to speak. It is not that massive people complain because something that was quoted by them has not been said so. That is why I say it is more of work practice and foreseeable obedience than really a legal practice that would be restrictive. To make the journalist courage, I have a meaningful way of dealing with quotations and interviews in my\nsketched.\nI can only speak from the point of view of a consumer magazine. Those companies we hurt are often SMEs. We cover maladministrations and also report on smaller businesses that are damaging consumers with a fraudulent mash. Our experience shows that even smaller businesses are also defending themselves, often before printing an article.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThey investigate cancer treatment, feel mines in Ukraine, rescue coral reefs or develop sustainable packaging from fungal tissue.\nBut it is clear that the little man and the little woman who are already struggling with the turmoil that triggers a negative media report in the circle of friends and families will hardly have the baptism and the means to start a mediation process.\nIn the short and medium term, they benefit from the fact that certain research is not done and because whistleblowers do not dare to speak publicly.\nIn the long term, however, it is harmful. Legislation, which prevents the working up of deficiencies and maladministration, is rather harmful in the long term. Because in the end it comes back to us via pressure from abroad. This may cost the banking and financial center more than if you would work it up yourself.\nArticles in this story\nSet voices of freedom from all over the world\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

He now works in Milan and continues to make his voice heard: \"The voice, if it is sincere, must always be heard. The voice that speaks of freedom always finds an echo and those who are willing to listen to it. And so my voice spreads through every free spirit that can listen to me,\" says Omobono.\nMore\n\nStable land, stable money, stable life plans: In comparison, a lot runs around Switzerland. One factor is the high confidence.\nAnd what does democracy need to return to Venezuela? \"We have to fight for it and enjoy a lot of sympathy worldwide, but it's up to us to use it. We must ensure that Venezuela is once again becoming one of the most advanced democracies in Latin America. A country that took up all those who fled from dictatorships that prevailed in neighbouring countries, and also many Italian, Spanish and other exiles: welcome here,\" says Carlos Omobono in our new edition of the series \"Votes of Freedom\".\nSet voices of freedom from all over the world",

As a journalist, author, moderator and documentary filmmaker, D\u00fcndar was a great critic Erdogans \u2013 and therefore advised the government. After discovering that Turkey was illegally supplying weapons to Syria in 2015, D\u00fcndar was accused of spying and terrorist support in several processes.\nAfter a failed attack \u2013 a man shot him in front of a courthouse \u2013 the journalist left the country in 2016.

Entrepreneurs, journalists, elected politicians or simply active citizens. They are also professional, public questions. Small and big. Controversial or even less controversial. What unites them is the daily commitment that they can freely express themselves and \u2013 that is important \u2013 are also heard.\nIn the age of digitalization, global social media and pandemic, freedom of expression is a matter of defending every day. These are the people behind the voices that we have met for our short video series \"Voices of Freedom from all over the world\". Around the world, in very different places, under the most diverse conditions and in many different contexts, they make themselves strong for freedom of expression and democracy.\nOur journey to the \"Voices of Freedom\" begins on the small Japanese island of Ishigaki, almost 2000 kilometers south of Tokyo. The 28-year-old Manami Mihara lives here.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nA small island in the South Japanese Sea became a centre of direct democracy.\nFrom Ishigaki and the East China Sea we travel to Central Asia and Afghanistan, where in recent years the Islamist Taliban regime has radically cut the rights of the female population. The young human rights activist Fatima Haidiri is based on the exile for Afghan.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nFatima Haidari was a radio moderator of the show \"Winner Women\" in Afghanistan. She fled and continues her fight for freedom in Italy.\nEllie Kisyombe, who came from East African Malawi and arrived more than ten years ago as an asylum seeker in the Irish capital Dublin, is the next stop for our virtual journey around the globe.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nEllie Kisyombe has managed to be heard in Ireland \u2013 the first asylum seeker to become a politician.\nIn Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, re-elected in May, has taken the country step by step from democracy in the last twenty years. Critics like the journalist Can D\u00fcndar had to leave his country. From Germany, he has been committed to the democratic future of his homeland.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe climate in Turkey has been more repressive for years. The journalist Can D\u00fcndar had to leave his country.\nIn Russia, the situation for media professionals has deteriorated so since the beginning of the war of attack against neighbor Ukraine that independent journalists such as the Russian-Ukrainian chief redactor of the online platform Meduza Galina Timchenko are now reporting from the Latvian capital Riga.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nGalina Timchenko, the Russian-Ukrainian chief director of Meduza.io, writes what Russian media can no longer publish.\nBut even in countries where democracy has made progress in recent years, journalists live dangerously. Like in Mexico, where there are \"no security guarantees for freedom of expression\" \u2013 said Joel Vera to SWI swissinfo.ch.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nJoel Vera, journalist in Mexico: He had to close his news portal after the murder of two colleagues.\nAnd even in a stable and old democracy like Switzerland, freedom of press and opinion is sometimes under pressure. Marie Maurisse, who at SWI swissinfo.ch with the podcast \"\n\"is present, gives out the online magazine Gotham City in the Swiss city of Lausanne. Together with her team, she covers economic crimes and experiences the limits of press freedom every day.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nA new law would prevent journalists from writing an article as they want, says the Swiss investigative author.\nThese voices by journalists: insiders from different countries and continents of the world make clear why freedom of the press is such a high asset for which it is worth making every day.\nWhat are your most important voices of freedom? Write it to us in the debate!\nFurther aspects of freedom of expression can be found on our focus page:\nMore\n\nA cornerstone of democracy is blurring. Who protects freedom of expression?

After eleven days of intense struggles on the 21st May a ceasefire was negotiated, mainly through the mediation of Egypt and the UN, and a mutual and simultaneous attitude of the fighting.\nMore than 230 Palestinians died and 11 death victims were counted in Israel. The injured go to the thousands, the infrastructure damage is immense in the Gaza Strip.\nEven during the warfare, Jewish organizations in Switzerland demanded the classification of Hamas as a terrorist organization. In a\nthe Swiss Jewish Community Federation (SIG) and the platform of Swiss liberal Jews (PLJS) described Hamas as \"clearly extremist, terrorist and anti-Semitic\". It could not be that \"the Hamas can move freely in Switzerland, collect donations and finance.\" The Israeli Embassy in Bern demanded the same.\nThe demand is not new:\nSVP National Council Christian Imark from the Federal Council to ban Hamas or to classify it as a terrorist organization. On request, Imark explains after the latest escalation: \"The Hamas as a terrorist organization would still be right. Especially because Hamas repeatedly acts as an aggressor and uses its own population as human shields.\"\nIn fact, only al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS) have been considered as terrorist organisations in Switzerland. Direct talks with them are not possible for the Swiss government. And this is also the reason why the Federal Council so far did not want to respond to the demand: as part of its peace policy in the region, it is important to talk to all actors and to be able to offer the good services of Switzerland. Both between Israel and the Palestinians and the internal Palestinian dialogue between the Islamist Hamas and the secular Fatah.\nThis has not changed after the latest outbreak of violence. On request, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informs: \"The EDA has taken note of the SIG's demand. Switzerland\u2019s [...] mentioned position is still valid. Hamas denies Israel's right of existence and defends the armed struggle as a legitimate means of resistance. Switzerland condemns these positions in all clarity.\"\nSwitzerland has been in contact with all conflict parties and has also called on Hamas in Gaza to stop all violence and to ensure compliance with international humanitarian law and human rights.\nThe fact that the EU did not play a significant role in the arms movement has several reasons. Since it has classified Hamas as a terrorist organization, it cannot conduct direct talks with it \u2013 the same applies to numerous other states. Some have only classified the military arm of Hamas, the al-Quds Brigades, as terrorist, but not the entire organization.\nThe pressure that Hamas should be classified as terrorist has increased after the recent escalation in various countries. For example, the German Chancellor candidate of the Union demanded that Armin Laschet (CDU) prohibit the flag of Hamas, while others spoke for a total ban on the organisation. Hamas is also not prohibited in Germany.\nHowever, it wonders how a ban would be targeted \u2013 according to analysts, Hamas is now considered to be the strongest political force beyond the Gaza Strip: there it has been ruling since 2007, in the West Bank and among the Arab Israelis, and it continues to gain support. The Middle East expert Erich Gysling interviewed the\nthe dilemma: \"The Hamas is the political winner on the Palestinian side. You have to stay in touch with them. To call them terrorists does not help anyone.\"\nMore\nDebates\nIs Switzerland cowardly or clever not to call Hamas a terrorist organization?\nMore\n\nAs Switzerland is struggling with its traditional neutrality concept.\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                    "Die Ausf\u00e4lle gegen Israel, die Malcus in den 2000ern erlebt hatte, geh\u00f6rten da schon seit Jahrzehnten zu etwas, was die Schweizer Linken zumindest in Kauf genommen hat. In seiner Z\u00fcrcher Kindheit w\u00e4hrend des Zweiten Weltkriegs in den 1940ern haben Kinder Steine nach Emanuel Hurwitz geschmissen und ihm antisemitische Beleidigungen nachgerufen.",
                    "\"Diesen offensichtlichen Antisemitismus habe ich sp\u00e4ter in der Linken nie erlebt\", stellt er im Gespr\u00e4ch mit swissinfo.ch klar. Nach dem Studium engagierte sich Hurwitz in der sozialdemokratischen Partei. Er wurde ins Parlament des Kanton Z\u00fcrich gew\u00e4hlt, politisierte im linken Fl\u00fcgel. Die Haltung der SP zum Nahostkonflikt empfand Hurwitz in den 1970ern als reflektiert.",
                    "Doch dies habe sich mit dem Beginn des Libanon-Kriegs, in dem Israel als Aggressor auftrat, ge\u00e4ndert. \"Ab 1982 herrschte unglaubliche Erregung in der SP\", erinnert sich Hurwitz. Er sei als j\u00fcdischer Vertreter in der Linken an \"unz\u00e4hlige Podiumsdiskussionen\" eingeladen worden, die sich dann \"als reine Propagandaveranstaltungen zugunsten der PLO\" entpuppten. Dabei seien ihm \"seltsame Argumentationsmuster\" aufgefallen: \"Israel war das B\u00f6se und die pal\u00e4stinensische PLO hat begeisterte Zustimmung erfahren.\"",
                    "Der \"Hass und Fanatismus, der da durchbrach\", habe ihn \u00fcberrascht und \u00fcberrumpelt. F\u00fcr diese D\u00e4monisierung findet er nur eine Erkl\u00e4rung: \"Antisemitismus.\" Hurwitz, von Beruf Psychiater, hat damals versucht, das seinen Genoss:innen zu erkl\u00e4ren: Wie eine jahrhundertealte Tradition antisemitischer Vorurteile in einer politisch aufgeladenen Situation an die Oberfl\u00e4che dringen kann.",
                    "Seine Genoss:innen haben das nicht h\u00f6ren wollen. Am 1. Mai 1984 trat Hurwitz aus dem Parlament zur\u00fcck und aus der Partei aus. Zur Aussprache, die ihm die SP Z\u00fcrich vor beinahe 40 Jahren versprach, ist es nie gekommen. Doch seit 2019 definiert die SP Schweiz f\u00fcr sich und ihre Gremien Antisemitismus nach der IHRA-Definition, die israelbezogene Formen von Antisemitismus explizit miteinschliesst. Gegen\u00fcber swissinfo.ch sagte Hurwitz, dass ihm diese sp\u00e4te Einsicht seiner Ex-Genoss:innen schon etwas bedeute. Im Februar ist er 86j\u00e4hrig verstorben.",
                    "Berthold Rothschild verband mit Emanuel Hurwitz eine lange Freundschaft. Rothschild politisierte in den 1980ern in der kommunistischen Partei der Arbeit (PdA). Lange habe bei den Kommunist:innen Israel als \"heroische Nation in den Geburtswehen\" gegolten, erz\u00e4hlt Rothschild. \"Genauso pl\u00f6tzlich drehte es dann.\"\u00a0Bevor er \u2013 zu \u00e4hnlicher Zeit wie Hurwitz \u2013 aus der PdA ausgetreten ist, habe er immer mal wieder erlebt, wie unter Kommunist:innen Stereotypen auftraten, etwa, dass J\u00fcd:innen die Linke im Zweifelsfall verraten w\u00fcrden.",

Er habe um diese Freundschaften immer gerungen, sei aber bei manchen \u00c4usserungen schon abrupt aufgestanden und nachhause gegangen. Gleichzeitig verstehe er, dass die israelische Politik und ihr Umgang mit den Pal\u00e4stinenser:innen viele Linke emp\u00f6re \u2013 und die Emp\u00f6rung ja oft begr\u00fcndet sei.",

                    "Damit sie da nicht in antisemitische Chiffren fallen, m\u00fcssen sich diese Aktivist:innen extrem genau beobachten. \"So wie ich mir des Rassismus, den mir die Gesellschaft mitgibt, bewusst bin, hoffe ich, dass sich andere bewusst sind, dass sie antisemitische Z\u00fcge in sich tragen.\"",
                    "Manche befreundete Linke seien so reflektiert, dass sie Rothschild Flyer oder Polittexte zur Testlekt\u00fcre vorlegen: Transportiert der Text unbeabsichtigt antisemitische Stereotypen? Doch das sind eher Ausnahmen.",
                    "Laut dem stellvertretenden Leiter des Zentrums f\u00fcr J\u00fcdische Studien der Universit\u00e4t Basel, Erik Petry, muss die Linie von Fall zu Fall gezogen werden: \"Oft kommt eine toxische Mischung zusammen, die eben nicht auf einer Kritik an der Politik des Staates beruht, sondern auf der Annahme, dass es hier ein unmoralisches Verhalten gibt, das mit dem J\u00fcdischsein zu tun hat.\" Das erlebe Petry auf linker Seite oft.",
                    "Politische Gegner:innen heben gerne hervor, dass es auch einen linken Antisemitismus gibt. Die Historikerin Christina Sp\u00e4ti beobachtet Versuche mancher \"rechter\" Politiker:innen sich so vom eigenen Antisemitismus \"reinzuwaschen\". Das bedeute aber nicht, dass es den linken Antisemitismus nicht wirklich gebe, sagt die Professorin an der Universit\u00e4t Fribourg und der FernUni Schweiz.",
                    "In ihrer Dissertation \"Die schweizerische Linke und Israel \u2013 Israelbegeisterung, Antizionismus und Antisemitismus zwischen 1967 und 1991\" ordnete Sp\u00e4ti in n\u00fcchterner Sprache Zeitungsberichte und Vorf\u00e4lle ein, die antisemitische Ressentiments in linken Kreisen offenbaren.",
                    "So erschien etwa in der sozialdemokratischen Presse 1970 ein Kommentar, der die Entf\u00fchrung Adolf Eichmanns durch Israel als \"Schlag ins Gesicht Argentiniens\" geisselte. Die gr\u00f6sste linke Zeitung der Schweiz verglich die israelische Politik in den 1980er-Jahren mehrfach mit der Politik der \"Endl\u00f6sung\" \u2013\u00a0dem Naziwort f\u00fcr die Ausl\u00f6schung der J\u00fcd:innen in Europa.",
                    "Sp\u00e4ti liefert unz\u00e4hlige weitere Beispiele. Immerhin der Kommentar zu Eichmanns Entf\u00fchrung hat beim Erscheinen 1970 zu einem Aufschrei gef\u00fchrt. Zu grotesk war der Antisemitismus in dem Artikel. Die subtileren Vorf\u00e4lle erfuhren keine vergleichbare Reaktion. Sp\u00e4ti kommt zum Fazit, es gebe eine \"Kontinuit\u00e4t der linken Indifferenz gegen\u00fcber Antisemitismus\". W\u00e4hrend in Deutschland in den 1990ern eine Reflexion startete, sei es in der Schweiz ein Tabu geblieben, erz\u00e4hlt sie im Gespr\u00e4ch mit swissinfo.ch.",
                    "Doch in den letzten Jahren nimmt Sp\u00e4ti innerhalb linker Kreise ein wachsendes Bed\u00fcrfnis wahr, sich mit Antisemitismus im eigenen Umfeld auseinanderzusetzen. Eine linke Aktivistin gegen Antisemitismus hat swissinfo.ch geschildert, wie ihr in den 1990er-Jahren bei Aufkl\u00e4rungsveranstaltungen zum Thema in Z\u00fcrich, andere Linke,\u00a0M\u00e4nner, mit einem \"Schuss ins Knie\" gedroht haben. Anfang 2000er l\u00f6sten ein Text und eine Karikatur auf der Plattform Indymedia eine innerlinke Debatte und eine Strafanzeige aus. Die Betreiber:innen von Indymedia Schweiz fanden den Text selbst antisemitisch, wollten ihn aber nicht l\u00f6schen.",
                    "In dieser \"Psychodynamik der Eskalation\" seien Freundschaften zerbrochen, schrieb dazu die linke \"Wochenzeitung\". Diese zitierte damals auch einen Verantwortlichen, der behauptete, \"Rassismus\" lasse sich \"grunds\u00e4tzlich nicht mit staatlichen Mitteln\", wie etwa der Antirassismus-Strafnorm, \"bek\u00e4mpfen\". Eine Position, die in der Schweizer Linken 20 Jahre danach wohl kaum mehr jemand \u00f6ffentlich \u00e4ussern w\u00fcrde. Die feministischen und antirassistischen Bewegungen der letzten Jahre haben breit f\u00fcr Diskriminierungsthemen sensibilisiert.",
                    "Trotzdem sp\u00fcren junge, j\u00fcdisch gelesene Linke, bis heute wie antisemitische Muster innerhalb ihres Umfelds an die Oberfl\u00e4che dringen. Anna Rosenwasser labelt sich als \"halb so j\u00fcdisch wie ihr Name klingt\". Darauf angesprochen, sagt die 32-J\u00e4hrige: \"Von Antisemitismus bin ich aber nicht halb betroffen.\" Auf Instagram, wo sie etwa Abstimmungsthemen erkl\u00e4rt und sich zu queeren und feministischen Themen positioniert, folgen ihr 25'000 Menschen.",
                    "Den Antisemitismus, den sie ausserhalb der Linken erlebt, empfindet Rosenwasser als bedrohlicher. Doch Linke stellen h\u00f6here Anspr\u00fcche an sich: \"Dass es in der Linken einen bewussten Umgang mit Antisemitismus braucht, ist f\u00fcr mich klar. In unserer Gesellschaft sind antisemitische Denkmuster verbreitet. Sie zu kennen und zu reflektieren, sehe ich als wichtige antifaschistische Aufgabe.\"",
                    "Dina Wyler sagt, viele Menschen seien \u00fcberzeugt, dass J\u00fcd:innen privilegiert seien und deshalb gar nicht diskriminiert werden k\u00f6nnen. \"Gerade von Linken wird ihnen die Diskriminierungserfahrung oft abgesprochen.\u201c",

                "en_content": "When Amir Malcus drives the stroller, he runs past a left-alternative bar. A shield before it tells: racism is not tolerated, as little as sexism, homophobia and other forms of discrimination. But a term is missing: anti-Semitism. Typically, the 37-year-old social worker finds.\nAlthough Malcus committed himself for many years, he is today disappointed by the left: \"For me it was frustrating to see how widespread anti-Semitism is in the part of society in which I put most hope.\"\nAnti-Semitism is widespread in society \u2013 as in the political left. swissinfo.ch asked Swiss Jews:insides, historians:inside, who accumulate or counterbalance the left, how they experience dealing with anti-Semitism in this environment.\n\nSign up for our newsletter and receive swissinfo.ch's top stories directly in your mailbox.\nAntisemitism belonged to everyday life in the conservative valley where Malcus grew up. In the small groups with which he occupied houses, he was able to explain about anti-Semitic stereotypes, for example, that not all Jews are rich. When he came out of the valley and devoted himself to global themes, he realized that anti-Semitism was not only ubiquitous in his valley.\nAt sessions, he regularly experienced failures against Israel: \"Parols like 'we will burn down your land' were not addressed to me, but I have heard them.\" At demonstrations against the Iraq war or the World Economic Forum WEF, Malcus disturbed the unreflected use of caricatures of capitalists, who often acted as anti-Semitic cartoons.\nA sub-complex capitalism critique is connectable to anti-Semitic world images, in which alleged \"screamers\" indulge in control, and often uses Jewish images with a long tradition. This was demonstrated by the young socialist party Juso, who published a cartoon during a 2016 vote, in which a \"speculant\" was presented as a man with a large nose, cylinder and temple bells.\n\"Antisemitism is a transformative artist,\" says Dina Wyler, who worked until a short time at the foundation against racism and anti-Semitism GRA. \"He always adapts to the applicable narratives and often comes up with image language or encoded words to remain 'salonable'.\"\nThe failures against Israel, which had experienced Malcus in the 2000s, have been part of something that the Swiss left has at least accepted for decades. In his Zurich childhood during World War II in the 1940s, children threw stones to Emanuel Hurwitz and called him anti-Semitic insults.\n\"I have never experienced this obvious anti-Semitism later in the left,\" he says in conversation with swissinfo.ch. After studying, Hurwitz engaged in the Social Democratic Party. He was elected to the parliament of the canton of Zurich, politicized in the left wing. The attitude of the SP to the Middle East conflict was reflected by Hurwitz in the 1970s.\nBut this has changed with the beginning of the Lebanon war, in which Israel appeared as an aggressor. \"From 1982 there was incredible excitement in the SP,\" recalls Hurwitz. He was invited as a Jewish representative in the left to \"countless panel discussions\" which then \"dept as pure propaganda events for the PLO\". \"Israel was evil and the Palestinian PLO has experienced enthusiastic approval.\"\nThe \"hate and fanaticism that broke through it\" surprised him and overwhelmed him. For this demonization he finds only one explanation: \"Anti-Semitism.\" Hurwitz, by profession psychiatrist, at the time tried to explain his genus: how a centuries-old tradition of anti-Semitic prejudices can penetrate the surface in a politically charged situation.\nHis comrades: inside did not want to hear that. On 1 May 1984 Hurwitz returned from Parliament and left the party. It has never come to the debate that SP Zurich promised him nearly 40 years ago. However, since 2019, SP Switzerland has defined antisemitism for itself and its bodies according to the IHRA definition that explicitly includes the forms of antisemitism related to israel. Speaking to swissinfo.ch, Hurwitz said that this late insight of his ex-genesis was already a little vague. In February he died 86 years.\nBerthold Rothschild combined a long friendship with Emanuel Hurwitz. Rothschild politicized in the 1980s in the Communist Party of Labour (PdA). For a long time, the communist: in Israel as a \"heroic nation in the woes of birth\", Rothschild tells. \"Just suddenly it turned.\" Before he \u2013 at a similar time as Hurwitz \u2013 stepped out of the PdA, he has experienced again and again how among communists: stereotypes occurred, for example, that J\u00fcd:inside the left would be betrayed in a doubt.\nRothschild emphasizes the dilemma he still feels in relation to Israel/Palestine: he has very good friends: in those who were long blind to the Jewish hatred of Hizbollah or Hammas. He has always fought for these friendships, but he had already risen abruptly in some appearances and went home. At the same time, he understands that Israeli politics and their dealings with the Palestinians are outrageous \u2013 and the outrage is often justified.\nA friend is on site for the population of Gaza. \"I understand that you become propal anesthetic when you experience this situation. This implies that you become fanatic anti-Israel.\" Anti-Israel is not anti-Semitic. \"But it's not far from it.\" Anti-Semitism, says Rothschild, is unresolved in the left, denied, displaced.\nTo prevent them from falling into anti-Semitic ciphers, these activists have to observe themselves extremely accurately. \"As I am aware of the racism that society gives me, I hope that others are aware that they carry anti-Semitic traits.\"\nSome left friends are so reflected that they present Rothschild flyers or polio texts to test reading: Does the text unintentionally transport anti-Semitic stereotypes? But these are more exceptions.\nAccording to the deputy head of the Center for Jewish Studies at the University of Basel, Erik Petry, the line has to be drawn down by case: \"Oft comes a toxic mixture which is not based on a criticism of the state's policy, but on the assumption that there is an immoral behaviour here that has to do with Jewishism.\" Petry's on the left often experience.\nPolitical opponents: there is also a left anti-Semitism. Historian Christina Sp\u00e4ti observes attempts by some \"right\" politicians: to \"wash\" himself from his own anti-Semitism. But this does not mean that left anti-Semitism does not really exist, says the professor at the University of Fribourg and the FernUni Switzerland.\nIn her dissertation \"Die schweizerische Linke und Israel \u2013 Israel-Environment, Anti-Zionism and Anti-Semitism between 1967 and 1991\", Sp\u00e4ti ordered newspaper reports and incidents in sober language that reveal anti-Semitic resentments in left circles.\nIn 1970, for example, a commentary was published in the Social-Democratic Press, which was toss the kidnapping of Adolf Eichmann by Israel as a \"slag in the face of Argentina\". In the 1980s, the largest leftist newspaper in Switzerland compared Israeli politics with the politics of \"final solution\" \u2013 the Nazi word for the extinction of Jews in Europe.\nLatei offers countless other examples. After all, the commentary on Eichmann's kidnapping led to a shout at the show in 1970. Anti-Semitism was too grotesque in the article. The more subtle incidents did not experience a comparable reaction. Lately comes to the conclusion that there is a \"continuity of the left indifference to anti-Semitism\". While a reflection began in Germany in the 1990s, it remained a taboo in Switzerland, she talks with swissinfo.ch.\nIn recent years, however, in left circles, Sp\u00e4ti has a growing need to deal with anti-Semitism in its own environment. A left-wing activist against anti-Semitism has described swissinfo.ch as in the 1990s, at reconnaissance events on the topic in Zurich, other left-wing, men, with a \"shot into the knee\". At the beginning of 2000, a text and a cartoon on the Indymedia platform triggered an inner-left debate and a criminal complaint. Operators: Indymedia Switzerland found the text itself anti-Semitic, but did not want to delete it.\nIn this \"psychodynamics of escalation\" friendships were broken, the left \"weekly newspaper\" wrote. This also quoted a responsible person who claimed that \"racism\" could not be \"fighted with state resources\", such as the antiracism criminal law. A position that, in the Swiss left 20 years after that, hardly anyone would publicly expose. The feminist and antiracist movements of recent years have been widely sensitized to discrimination issues.\nNevertheless, young, Jewish-read lefts still feel like anti-Semitic patterns within their environment penetrate the surface. Anna Rosenwasser is labeled \"a half as Jewish as her name sounds.\" The 32-year-old says, \"I am not half affected by anti-Semitism.\" On Instagram, where she explains about voting issues and positions herself on queer and feminist issues, 25'000 people follow her.\nRosenwasser feels more threatening to the anti-Semitism that she experiences outside the left. But left-wing claims are higher: \"That in the left it needs a conscious handling of anti-Semitism is clear to me. Anti-Semitic patterns are common in our society. Knowing and reflecting you, I see as an important antifascist task.\"\nDina Wyler says that many people are convinced that Jews are privileged and therefore cannot be discriminated against at all. \"Especially from the left, discrimination experiences are often denied to them. \u2018\nMore\n\nIn crises, many people tend to form anti-Semitic patterns \u2013 for centuries. Switzerland also has a longer history.\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "en_content": "If you want to go in, military and police will happen from all corners of Switzerland. Then Swiss German becomes rare. The more than a thousand guests, including entrepreneurs: inside and outside the world, have traveled from almost all regions of the world. In addition to Hebrew, English is the transport language. Of the conference stages, two words can be heard particularly frequently, usually as a call: Dreamer! Visionary!\nThe terms sometimes aim at all early Zionists: inside, but mostly on Theodor Herzl. On 29 August 1897 he called to Basel for the first Zionist Congress. Herzl was initiator and then founding president of the World Zionist organization. \"If you want, it's not a dream,\" he wrote: a Jewish state that protects Jewish people from anti-Semitic persecution and discrimination.\n\"If you want, it's not a dream,\" says on 29. August 2022 everywhere on posters and projections. The country is long since real: the state of Israel celebrates its 75th year. Birthday. The country has also arrived in reality, in the contradictions and defeats of everyday life. But Herzl's dream didn't end at the state foundation.\nWith the motto \"Create the past and build a vision for the future\", the host greets the audience on Sunday. The two-day conference is in phase a TED talk event: There are sophisticated speeches that combine a personal story with great ideas. But even at panel discussions there is no room for questions from the audience.\nThis means that possible contradictions are not discussed at least in plenary. Commemoration is unanimous. It is reminiscent of the 2000 years of exile to the destruction of six million Jews in the Shoa. Similarly, many emphasise their concern about the global increase in anti-Semitic attacks and affirm a decisive action against them.\nBut there are differences in the vision for the future: if, for example, Yaakov Hagoel, Chairman of the World Zionist Organization, announces that within ten years the majority of the Jews should live in Israel worldwide, it wonders whether this can also be in the sense of the Jewish diaspora. Of the 15 million Jews in the world today, outside of Israel most live in the USA.\nAfterman Shai, Israel's Minister of Diaspora Suits, focuses more on participation. In Basel, he outlines the plan that Israel should offer Jews and Jews a way of political participation in Israel worldwide.\nRabbi Azman has come to Basel by train \u2013 because there are no flights from Ukraine. \"For Jews who have nothing, Israel means everything,\" says the Chief Rabbi of Ukraine. For those who are now fleeing, the \"Alija\" \u2013 this is the possibility of all Jews and Jewish women to emigrate to Israel \u2013 is of great importance.\nAzman illustrates them on his own example. Over 30 years ago, he left with his wife the falling Soviet Union. When they waited for their connecting flight in Vienna, his highly pregnant woman even got a pineapple from a supporter that she had longed for.\nThe idea of \"Alija\" is older than political Zionism, but decisive for it. Zionist: Inside are convinced that political and social emancipation without Jewish state does not guarantee security. \"In the 19th century, optimistic Jewish thinkers believed that the 'Jewish question', anti-Semitism, would disappear discrimination by emancipation,\" says Israeli success author Micah Goodman in his speech.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to Jews, hate fantasies hardly know borders. Many bellies have emerged in the European Middle Ages.\nAt that time, under the impression of the ideals of enlightenment, the persecution was overcome. Herzl opposed this emancipation promise to the belief that anti-Semitic hatred in Western Europe was suppressed. \"So if emancipation is not the solution \u2013 what is the solution? Zionism is successful where emancipation is condemned to failure.\" This is, according to Goodman, the essence of Herzl's first writing \"The Jewish State\".\nBut in the future Israel and the Jewish diaspora must refer more strongly to Herzl's second influential writing: \"Altneuland\". This could contain the next generation of Zionism. A Zionism that finds \"Jewish solutions for universal problems\". As examples, Goodman calls climate warming and political polarisation, which he sees as a \"social counterpart of climate warming\". The applause on it is frenetic.\n\"Altneuland\", published in 1902, tells the story of a Jewish ideal society in Palestine: democratic, solidarity, equal rights for all. Also for Arab people. So did Goodman encode the Middle East conflict?\nMore\n\n\n\n\nOver all years, the people in Switzerland were in favour of the Zionist movement. With few exceptions.\nThe question must remain open, but it is pushing. For as long as the occupation continues, the Zionist idea will hardly become exemplary beyond the Jewish world. The Middle East conflict is absent and present over a wide range of parts of the conference.\nHe is the elephant in the room as well as Yves Kugelmann in\nsays, but no taboo. In talks with swissinfo.ch, Israeli parliamentarians talk:in Moshe Tur-Paz of the liberal government party and Shirly Pinto of the right government party openly about their perspective on the subject.\nTur-Paz lives in a settlement in the West Bank, whose origin is older than the Israeli state, but which is nevertheless classified by the United Nations as illegal under international law. Tur-Paz says, \"I believe that my ancestors have been promised all Israel. Still, I'm not blind.\"\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland played an important role as a meeting place in the Zionist movement. The 125-year anniversary will be celebrated at the end of August.\nHe sees the Arab population living in the area \u2013 partly with Israeli passport, partly not. Some are his friends. \"As the majority of people in Israel, I live in a sort of solution that lies somewhere between the right of autonomy and one's own country,\" says Knesset's MEP.\nShirly Pinto emphasises that it is crucial to develop the \"Palestinian economy and improve Palestinian life\". With regard to the Arab Israelis, the state must ensure \"that they have everything other people have.\"\nIn two months are elections in Israel. Pinto and Tur-Paz are still members of the same government and emphasize how important it is that an Arab-Islamic party is represented for the first time in their government coalition. Israel is a Jewish state, but it is related to the same rights for all citizens.\nThe words \"Visionary\" and \"Dreamer\" are also mentioned in conversation with Pinto and Tur Paz. \"Zionism is the story of how the Israeli nation dreams of the land of Zion, after 2000 years of exile makes the best. Since the foundation of the state, it means that Jews and Jews from all over the world can orient themselves to Israel,\" says Tur Paz.\nPinto declares that in Israel every contribution to living together is a contribution to Zionism: \"Ob educational work or army service \u2013 everything is part of Herzl's vision.\"\nThe greatest enthusiasm for a lecture is the former Mossad director Yossi Cohen. The Israeli secret service is part of the Zionism realized in Israel, he says. And describes how the Mossad prevented an Iranian nuclear bomb.\nThe final gala later brings light show, fog and pop music. Here the interpretation of Herzl's work then takes some abstract trains. For example, he is compared with the CEO of a startup that helped Israel to succeed in crowdfunding.\nThe Swiss speakers at the Gala, the President of the Basle, Beat Jans and the Federal Council, Guy Parmelin, address the Middle East conflict. Parmelin gets intermediate applause when he speaks for the two-state solution.\nOf course, Israeli President Jitzchak Herzog also refers to Herzl, the forerunner of Zionism, who transferred \"Jewish identity to an effective political doctrine\". A year ago, a \"leading social media platform\" discussed whether the word \"Zionism\" should be treated as an insult because it was abused as an anti-Semitic code. Duke demands on the gala evening: \"We need to get back the term Zionism.\" Regain the interpretation sovereignty and translate it positively.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1930s, the anti-Semitic rush escalated against department stores in Jewish possession \u2013 and the Federal Council banned the expansion of department stores.\nOver the whole jubilee, a great commitment to understand Zionism idealistic, yes utopian. But how the ideal society of Herzl's \"Altneuland\" is to translate into real politics remains open. In contrast to the Dreamer Herzl, the Zionists describe: no empty leaf today.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nThe Jewish journalist Yves Kugelmann describes his view of the anniversary of the 1st. Zionist Congress \u2013 and the attack on the Palestine Demo.\nMore\n\nAs Switzerland is struggling with its traditional neutrality concept.\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

Finanzielle Schwierigkeiten begleiteten diese Institution dabei st\u00e4ndig. Seit ungef\u00e4hr 2010 hat sich die Situation aber kontinuierlich zugespitzt, da mehrere Geldgeber ihre Beitr\u00e4ge senkten. Ein grosses Loch verursachte insbesondere die zeitweilige Aussetzung der amerikanischen Finanzierung unter dem Ex-Pr\u00e4sidenten Donald Trump 2018, die unter seinem Nachfolger wieder aufgenommen wurde.",
                    "Es klaffe eine L\u00fccke zwischen dem, was von der Organisation erwartet werde, und den Mitteln, die man ihr daf\u00fcr zur Verf\u00fcgung stelle, sagt deren Leiter Philippe Lazzarini. Er hat die Finanzierung der Agentur weit oben auf seiner Priorit\u00e4tenliste, dazu geh\u00f6rt auch \u00d6ffentlichkeitsarbeit. Drastisch warnt Lazzarini: \"Diese wachsende Diskrepanz zwischen Erwartungen und Mitteln k\u00f6nnte zu einer Implosion der Organisation f\u00fchren.\"",
                    "Es w\u00e4re ein Untergang mit Ansage. Die gesprochenen Beitr\u00e4ge stagnieren seit mehr als einem Jahrzehnt \u2013 ein Jahrzehnt, das der Region mehrere Krisen brachte: Der Krieg in Syrien, der Kollaps des Libanon, die Corona-Pandemie, zuletzt das Erdbeben und die erneute Zunahme von t\u00f6dlicher Gewalt in Israel und Pal\u00e4stina. Diese haben die bei der UNRWA registrierten pal\u00e4stinensischen Fl\u00fcchtlinge wiederholt getroffen, und oft ist die Organisation das einzige Auffangbecken f\u00fcr sie. Ohne zus\u00e4tzliche Mittel k\u00f6nne man aber auf die steigenden Bed\u00fcrfnisse nicht reagieren. \"Der Status quo ist schlicht nicht mehr tragbar\", sagt Lazzarini.",
                    "Die UNRWA, das Hilfswerk der Vereinten Nationen f\u00fcr Pal\u00e4stina-Fl\u00fcchtlinge im Nahen Osten, war einst als tempor\u00e4re Organisation gegr\u00fcndet worden, um pal\u00e4stinensische Fl\u00fcchtlinge nach 1948 zu versorgen. Seither wird das Mandat alle drei Jahre verl\u00e4ngert. L\u00e4ngst ist daraus eine Institution entstanden, die staatliche Aufgaben erledigt \u2013 so bietet sie etwa medizinische Versorgung, Bildung und\u00a0Erziehung sowie\u00a0humanit\u00e4re Massnahmen an. Dies f\u00fcr eine registrierte Bev\u00f6lkerung von 5,6 Millionen Menschen in Jordanien, Syrien, dem Libanon und den pal\u00e4stinensischen Autonomiegebieten, die je nach politischer Grosswetterlage in unterschiedlichem Masse darauf angewiesen ist.",
                    "Darunter befinden sich zurzeit 550'000 Sch\u00fcler:innen, jeweils zwei Millionen Menschen sind auf medizinische Erstversorgung oder Nahrungsmittelhilfe angewiesen. Das Spezielle daran: Die rund 30'000 Mitarbeitenden der UNRWA sind gr\u00f6sstenteils selber Pal\u00e4stinenser:innen. Und die Organisation hat nicht nur zunehmend M\u00fche, ihre Hilfsdienste aufrechtzuerhalten, sondern auch deren L\u00f6hne auszuzahlen.",
                    "Da der Fl\u00fcchtlingsstatus vererbt wird, w\u00e4chst die Zahl der Fl\u00fcchtlinge kontinuierlich \u2013 und damit auch die Anforderungen an die UNRWA. Finanziert wird all das \u00fcber freiwillige Spenden. Der Grossteil des Budgets, im Jahr 2022 waren es 1,6 Milliarden Dollar, kommt von westlichen Staaten. Die Schweiz beteiligt sich seit langem mit rund 20 Millionen Franken j\u00e4hrlich.",
                    "Augenf\u00e4llig ist die geringe Beteiligung arabischer Staaten, die zudem in den letzten Jahren abgenommen hat. \"Man sieht eine Diskrepanz: Es wird viel Solidarit\u00e4t mit der pal\u00e4stinensischen Bev\u00f6lkerung ausgedr\u00fcckt, aber gleichzeitig werden immer weniger Mittel gesprochen\", sagt Lazzarini. Das ist Ausdruck der geopolitischen Verschiebungen in der Region: Manche arabischen Staaten wollen ihr Verh\u00e4ltnis zu Israel normalisieren, die schwindende Unterst\u00fctzung der pal\u00e4stinensischen Fl\u00fcchtlinge ist eine Konsequenz davon.",
                    "F\u00fcr die Pal\u00e4stina-Fl\u00fcchtlinge, die in zunehmend schwierigeren Umst\u00e4nden \u00fcberleben m\u00fcssten, habe das nicht nur finanzielle Konsequenzen, sagt Lazzarini: \"Es macht sich vermehrt das Gef\u00fchl breit, von der internationalen Gemeinschaft vergessen worden zu sein.\" Gepaart mit der weit verbreiteten Armut und Perspektivlosigkeit eine gef\u00e4hrliche Mischung.",
                    "Auch die Kritik an der UNRWA hatte in den letzten Jahren zugenommen. Es gab Vorw\u00fcrfe wegen Missmanagement und antisemitischen Inhalten in Schulb\u00fcchern. So sagte der Schweizer Aussenminister Ignazio Cassis nach einem Besuch in einem Lager in Jordanien 2018, die UNRWA sei zu einem \"Teil des Problems\" geworden \u2013 die Organisation sei also bei der L\u00f6sung der Pal\u00e4stinenserfrage ein Hindernis. Ein Narrativ, das insbesondere rechte Gruppierungen in Israel und den USA bereits l\u00e4nger verbreiten.",
                    "Der Vorg\u00e4nger von Lazzarini, der Schweizer Diplomat Pierre Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, musste 2019 seinen Hut nehmen, nachdem er wegen Managementproblemen stark kritisiert wurde. Auch das hatte zu Staus in den Spendenfl\u00fcssen gef\u00fchrt. Europ\u00e4ische Staaten, darunter auch die Schweiz, hatten ihre Zahlungen suspendiert.",
                    "Man nehme Kritik ernst, sagt Lazzarini und verweist auf interne Umstrukturierungen und rigorose Kontrollen des Schulmaterials, das von den Beh\u00f6rden des jeweiligen Einsatzgebiets bereitgestellt wird. \"Aber die UNRWA wird oft f\u00fcr die Probleme in der Region verantwortlich gemacht. Diese k\u00f6nnen jedoch nur auf politischer Ebene gel\u00f6st werden \u2013 und daf\u00fcr gibt es leider schon l\u00e4nger keine Anzeichen\", so Lazzarini.",
                    "Durch die Weiterf\u00fchrung des Fl\u00fcchtlingsstatus und dem Festhalten an das R\u00fcckkehrrecht w\u00fcrden Friedensverhandlungen verunm\u00f6glicht, ist eine oft angebrachte Kritik. Stattdessen solle mehr in die Integration der Fl\u00fcchtlinge im jeweiligen Land investiert werden. \"Die Voraussetzungen dazu gibt es jedoch in keinem dieser L\u00e4nder\", sagt der Leiter des Hilfswerks.",
                    "Unrealistische Erwartungen im Zusammenhang mit der Organisation sind auch Ausdruck der starken Politisierung des Themas. N\u00fcchterne Fehleranalysen und eine Reformierung der Organisation werden teilweise dadurch verunm\u00f6glicht, dass alles durch eine Entweder-oder-Brille gesehen wird: Der Vorwurf einseitig pro-pal\u00e4stinensisch, respektive pro-israelisch zu sein, ist schnell zur Hand.",
                    "Im Jahr 2024 feiert die UNRWA ihr 75-j\u00e4hriges Bestehen. Wie wenig sich manche Dinge ver\u00e4ndert haben, erl\u00e4utert Lazzarini anhand eines k\u00fcrzlichen Besuchs eines Fl\u00fcchtlingslagers in Beirut: \"Nach einem Dreivierteljahrhundert verteilen Sie immer noch Essen\", habe sich ein junger Bewohner an ihn gerichtet.",
                    "Wie also weiter? \"Unser Ziel ist klar: Wir m\u00f6chten eine Situation, in der es die UNRWA nicht mehr braucht\", sagt Lazzarini. Da das Mandat der UNRWA auf Beschl\u00fcssen der Uno-Generalversammlung basiert, kann jede \u00c4nderung der Situation der pal\u00e4stinensischen Fl\u00fcchtlinge nur \u00fcber einen politischen Prozess eingeleitet werden. F\u00fcr den Moment bleibt ihm also nichts anderes \u00fcbrig, als die L\u00fccken zu schliessen und Wege zu finden, die Finanzierung der UNRWA mittelfristig zu stabilisieren.",
                    "Bis eine politische L\u00f6sung gefunden wird, bleibt aber die Organisation unersetzlich, da seien sich alle Akteure einig, sagt Lazzarini. Zumindest aus Israel klingt das anders, auch wenn er die Beziehungen zu den israelischen Beh\u00f6rden als pragmatisch bezeichnet und ein Kollaps der Organisation kaum in deren Interesse sein kann. \"Zurzeit ist in der Region viel in Bewegung. Wir m\u00fcssen optimistisch bleiben, dass eine L\u00f6sung gefunden werden kann \u2013 das sind wir den Pal\u00e4stina-Fl\u00fcchtlingen schuldig.\" Das bedeutet aber auch: Das Provisorium wird auf absehbare Zeit bleiben.",

                "en_content": "When does a Provisional stop being a Provisional? For 74 years, UNRWA has been supporting Palestine refugees in the Middle East. Financial difficulties were constantly accompanied by this institution. Since about 2010, however, the situation has steadily increased as several donors lowered their contributions. A large hole in particular caused the temporary suspension of American financing under the ex-president Donald Trump 2018, which was resumed under his successor.\nThere is a gap between what is expected of the organization and the resources available to it, says its head Philippe Lazzarini. It has the funding of the agency far above its priority list, including public relations. Drastic warns Lazzarini: \"This growing discrepancy between expectations and resources could lead to an implosion of the organization.\"\nIt would be a decline with announcement. The speeches have been stagnating for more than a decade \u2013 a decade that brought several crises to the region: the war in Syria, the collapse of Lebanon, the corona-Pandemie, the earthquake and the renewed increase in deadly violence in Israel and Palestine. These have repeatedly met the Palestinian refugees registered with UNRWA, and often the organization is the only catching pool for them. Without additional funds, however, one cannot respond to the increasing needs. \"The status quo is simply no longer portable,\" says Lazzarini.\nThe UNRWA, the United Nations Relief Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Middle East, was once established as a temporary organisation to provide Palestinian refugees after 1948. Since then, the mandate has been extended every three years. This has led to the emergence of an institution that performs state tasks, such as medical care, education and education, as well as humanitarian measures. This is the case for a registered population of 5.6 million people in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinian Autonomous Areas, which depends on different levels of political weather.\nThere are currently 550'000 pupils: in each case two million people are dependent on initial medical care or food aid. The special thing about this: the approximately 30,000 UNRWA employees are the largest Palestinians themselves. And the organization has not only increasing efforts to maintain its aid services, but also to pay their wages.\nSince refugee status is inherited, the number of refugees continues to grow \u2013 and thus also the requirements for UNRWA. All this is financed through voluntary donations. The large part of the budget, in 2022 there were 1.6 billion dollars, comes from Western states. Switzerland has been involved for a long time with around CHF 20 million a year.\nThe low participation of Arab states, which has also declined in recent years, is obvious. \"You see a discrepancy: Much solidarity is expressed with the Palestinian population, but at the same time less and less resources are spoken,\" says Lazzarini. This is the expression of the geopolitical shifts in the region: some Arab states want to normalize their relationship with Israel, the devastating support of Palestinian refugees is a consequence of it.\nFor the Palestinian refugees, who would have to survive in increasingly difficult circumstances, this has not only financial consequences, says Lazzarini: \"It is increasingly the feeling that they have been forgotten by the international community.\" Coupled with widespread poverty and lack of perspective, a dangerous mix.\nThe criticism of the UNRWA had also increased in recent years. There were allegations about mismanagement and anti-Semitic contents in school books. After a visit to a camp in Jordan in 2018, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said that the UNRWA had become a \"part of the problem\" \u2013 so the organization was an obstacle in solving the Palestinian issue. A narrative that, in particular, spreads right-wing groups in Israel and the USA for a long time.\nThe predecessor of Lazzarini, the Swiss diplomat Pierre Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, had to take his hat in 2019 after being strongly criticised for management problems. This had also led to congestion in the donations. European states, including Switzerland, had suspended their payments.\nOne takes criticism seriously, says Lazzarini, referring to internal restructuring and rigorous controls of the school material provided by the authorities of the respective field of application. \"But the UNRWA is often blamed for the problems in the region. However, these can only be solved at a political level \u2013 and unfortunately there are no signs for this for a long time,\" says Lazzarini.\nBy continuing refugee status and adhering to the right of return, peace negotiations would be impossible, it is a frequently appropriate criticism. Instead, more should be invested in the integration of refugees in the respective country. \"However, there are no conditions in any of these countries,\" says the head of the aid.\nUnrealistic expectations associated with the organization are also an expression of the strong politicalisation of the topic. Sober error analyses and a reforming of the organization are partially impeded by seeing everything through an either-or-glass: The accusation of being one-sided pro-palaesthetic, or pro-Israel, is quick to hand.\nIn 2024, UNRWA celebrates its 75th anniversary. Lazzarini explains how little things have changed on the basis of a recent visit to a refugee camp in Beirut: \"After a three-quarter century, you still distribute food,\" a young resident addressed him.\nSo what? \"Our goal is clear: we want a situation where UNRWA no longer needs,\" says Lazzarini. Since the UNRWA mandate is based on decisions taken by the UN General Assembly, any change in the situation of Palestinian refugees can only be initiated through a political process. For the moment, he has no other choice but to close the gaps and find ways to stabilise the financing of the UNRWA in the medium term.\nUntil a political solution is found, however, the organization remains irreplaceable, as all actors agree, says Lazzarini. At least from Israel, this sounds different, even if he calls relations with the Israeli authorities as pragmatic and a collapse of the organization can hardly be in their interest. \"At the moment, a lot is moving in the region. We must remain optimistic that a solution can be found \u2013 we owe the Palestine refugees.\" This also means that the Provisional will remain foreseeable time.\nMore\n\nAs Switzerland is struggling with its traditional neutrality concept.\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

                "en_content": "I live in Jaffa, the Arabic part of Tel Aviv.\nOn Saturday morning I woke up half 7 by the rocket alarm. It is not pleasant to wake up, but we already know what to do. We have an alarm and a half minutes to get into a bunker.\nIn the old building where we live, there is no shelter. We're going to the stairwell, we're going as far away from glass as possible. The staircase is the most stable part of a building.\nWhen the Iron Dome sign catches the rocket, you hear a boom. You should wait for ten minutes. Saturday morning we experienced some alarms, then another three in the evening. It's been quieter since then. Just before, I heard a rocket alarm again, but not directly at our quarters.\nRight. The international high-tech company in which I work supports us very much in this situation. We can work if we can. My employees in Israel are currently mostly on-off, because many of them need to care for children at the same time. Friends of a working mate are missing.\nMany of my employees had to enter the army as a reservoir. I'm doing fine. I'm distracted by it, and I'm always on the rumblings, and I'd always expose myself to the pictures in the news and the social media.\nI'm not coming. I'm upset when I see something.\nEven I didn't hear from anyone who lives here and thinks about going. But my colleague at the Swiss Foreign Council seems to have received many calls. For me, it wouldn't be an option to return.\nLike most Swiss in Israel, I am a double citizen. In 2014 I made Alyiah, the Israeli state supports all Jewish people all over the world in the entry and obtaining of citizenship. So I don't think about returning to Switzerland, but I also understand myself as a Swiss, just as a foreign Swiss. That's why I'm in this community too.\nOn the velvet evening we got a helpful mail from the message where we were informed how to log in to the TravelAdmin app. But of course, this was the case with Swiss residents \u2013 not those who make holidays.\nMore\n\nStable land, stable money, stable life plans: In comparison, a lot runs around Switzerland. One factor is the high confidence.\nIt was probably more challenging for tourists. I heard about a corner, some did not know how to get in touch with the message. Of course, it is important that everyone who wants home can be flew out. I find it very difficult. At the moment it seems open whether there are still emergency flights from Switzerland. I'm hardly involved, but I'm trying to be there for Swiss people who live here if they have a problem.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nAttack from nothing: shock and insufficiency also among the nearly 30,000 Swiss who live in Israel.\nSwitzerland must recognize Hamas as a terrorist organization. In the media, I have read that the parliamentary \"Fundschaftsgruppe Schweiz \u2013 Palestine\" stands out. That's good.\nWhat I think is more critical is that no one from the Federal Council has clearly condemned Hamas' attack by Monday afternoon. Maybe it's not because of neutrality, but I think it's questionable.\nReporting is the only thing you can do. You can write us and think about us. In Israel we support each other mentally. But I also get a lot of news from Switzerland and many are also reporting to my parents who live in Switzerland. That's good for my parents, too. The participation is very large.\nArticles in this story\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nMore:",

Also for this scrutiny we are receiving messages of anger from all over the world, because the documents have not yet arrived or arrived late. In some cases it was no longer possible to send them back by mail. This is not an exception to the other elections and votes.\nThe Fifth Switzerland feels impeded in its democratic participation. This is a fact which regularly leads to parliamentary proposals and amendments. In March this year, the Federal Council published a\n, which analyses the various attempts to improve.\nSending electoral and voting documents abroad is regulated by an order. The material can be sent as soon as possible a week before the official shipment to Switzerland, i.e. six weeks before the vote. This year, the first useful date for sending Swiss citizens and citizens abroad was from September 11 (solar week 37).\n\"As in the past, the Federal Council has asked the cantons to ensure that the electoral documents for those residing abroad are sent before the official shipment to Switzerland,\" the Federal Chancellery tells us.\nWe wanted to know from the cantons if they respected this request and when they sent the documents to the Swiss and Swiss abroad.\nIt is not easy to conduct such an investigation. In total 14 cantons hold the electoral register of citizenship abroad on a decentralized basis \u2013 in other words, each municipality does it on its own. In nine cantons the electoral register is managed by the cantonal administration, while in three cantons the responsibility is of the administration of the cantonal capital.\nAll 26 cantons responded to SWI swissinfo.ch's request. Twelve of the fourteen cantons in which the municipalities are responsible for sending have notified the date of sending in the cantonal capital.\nIn our survey, the Canton of Argovia was revealed as the model student. While the first possible sending date set by the Confederation was September 11, the Canton of Argovia sent the documents already on September 8, 2023, then at the end of the solar week 36 (there was a weekend in between).\nA problem? No, he says without hesitation\n, which manages the Swiss vote register abroad in the Canton of Argovia (ZASR). B\u00fchlmann reckons from the weekend of the ballot, and Friday night is part of the weekend in his eyes. Thus, the Canton of Argovia respected the six weeks allowed before the voting weekend.\n\"We've been planning this for years so that we can deliver the documents packed to the post office on Friday night,\" says B\u00fchlmann. Documents must then be moved before they can be shipped.\n\"In this way, I assure you that the documents are not shipped in the course of the solar week 37\", says B\u00fchlmann, \"but on the first day possible\". In this way, he hopes to give the \"his\" and the \"sues\" abroad \u2013 especially on the other side of the ocean \u2013 the opportunity to participate in elections and votes.\nBehind this approach, however, there is also a security consideration, emphasizes the head of the Argoviese ZASR. \"The ballot contains sensitive data that must be protected,\" he says. According to B\u00fchlmann, when the mail is placed before the weekend, the responsibility for the 3.7 tons of material also passes to the post office.\nIn the canton of Argovia more than 12,500 citizens and citizens abroad are registered, but the Swiss Register Manager abroad would be pleased to see more participation of and international citizens. Despite the early sending of documents, not all the electorate registered abroad participates in elections and votes.\nArgovia is one of the cantons who would like to send the electoral material and vote earlier. According to the report of the Federal Council of March 2023, most cantons indicated that in principle this is possible.\nHowever, the Confederation does not agree. The report states that \"the process that goes from the drafting of the voting book to its press ready for sending, which takes several months, has already very tight times.\" To allow the expedition more than six weeks before the elections or the voting day, it would be necessary to carry out extensive organizational interventions in the production process. \"Something that is not easily feasible in a system that has been successful for years. \u201d\nBut the problem of late ballots does not disappear. \"These six weeks are often not enough. Shipment abroad sometimes takes up to four weeks,\" says B\u00fchlmann. This means that for the electorate abroad it is no longer possible to return the documents in time.\nFor the elections of 2023, at least Swiss and Swiss registered abroad in Basel City, St. Gallen and Turgovia will not have this problem. Document delivery depends on punctuality. But since this year they will be able to avail themselves of the electronic vote, the deadline for returning the ballots will no longer be valid.\nAccording to the information we collected, 26 of the 23 cantons sent the documents during the solar week 37 and then respected the instructions of the federal government. Only the cantons of the Jura (3'102 citizens and citizens abroad with voting rights) and Solothurn (4'195 electrics and voters abroad with voting rights) could not ship the electoral and voting material until the solar week 38. Why?\n\"Unfortunately there was a delay in packing, so it was possible to send it only in the 38th solar week\", writes the Deputy Secretary of State of Solothurn, Pascale von Roll, interviewed by SWI swissinfo.ch.\nIn the Canton Jura there was a delay in the distribution to the municipalities \"due to a delivery problem of part of the documents\". \"For this reason, the sending of voting material for municipalities was postponed to 18 September 2023,\" said the Secretary of State of the Canton Jura. However, the cantonal authorities do not know the extent of the delay. The Canton Jura is one of the 14 cantons in which the municipalities send the voting material.\nThe documents were then sent only during the calendar week 38, i.e. more than a week's delay than required by the Federal Council. Precious days that citizens and towns abroad of the Cantons of Solothurn and Jura are losing to participate in the elections.\nOther developments\n\nA milestone in vacilla democracy.

Naturalmente, questo lo sanno anche tutti gli Stati che hanno allontanato diplomatiche e diplomatici russi. \"Queste espulsioni rappresentano anche un segnale politico\", spiega H\u00e4nni. \"Tuttavia, dal febbraio 2022, alcuni Stati europei hanno espulso in modo molto mirato funzionari d'intelligence essenziali per le attivit\u00e0 delle basi di spionaggio nelle ambasciate. In alcuni casi, i loro posti sono stati subito soppressi, in modo che Mosca non potesse pi\u00f9 rioccuparli con nuove spie\".",
                    "La Svizzera si attiene invece alla sua tradizione di rimanere passiva in queste questioni, almeno in pubblico. \"V\u2019\u00e8 da presumere che, quando qualcuno si fa prendere troppo la mano, dietro le quinte la Svizzera se ne lamenti con il rispettivo Stato\", dice H\u00e4nni.",
                    "In ogni caso, le autorit\u00e0 hanno gi\u00e0 molta esperienza in materia: lo spionaggio \u00e8 praticato a Ginevra fin dalla Prima guerra mondiale. Oggi, la citt\u00e0 sul Lemano ospita quasi 240 rappresentanze estere, decine di organizzazioni internazionali, centinaia di ONG.",
                    "\u00c8 quindi nella natura delle cose che qui scorrazzino anche numerosi agenti. Ginevra \u00e8 oggi considerata uno dei tre crocevia dello spionaggio in Europa, insieme a Bruxelles e Vienna.",
                    "Durante la Guerra fredda, Vienna era considerata la \"citt\u00e0 delle spie\": anche qui svolgevano un ruolo centrale la presenza di organizzazioni internazionali, la neutralit\u00e0 e la posizione geografica. Per molto tempo, in Austria il personale diplomatico che lavorava per i servizi segreti \u00e8 stato trattato come in Svizzera: aveva mano libera.",
                    "Ma l\u2019anno scorso c\u2019\u00e8 stata una svolta: l\u2019Austria si \u00e8 unita agli Stati dell\u2019UE e ha espulso diverse persone. In tal modo le autorit\u00e0 austriache hanno reagito alle dure accuse che le erano state rivolte di essere troppo filorusse e di intrattenere talvolta collaborazioni dirette con organi russi.",
                    "Vienna ospita numerose importanti organizzazioni, tra cui le Nazioni Unite (ONU), l'Agenzia internazionale per l'energia atomica (AIEA), l'Organizzazione dei Paesi esportatori di petrolio (OPEC) e l'Organizzazione per la sicurezza e la cooperazione in Europa (OSCE).",
                    "Ma altri fattori svolgono un ruolo: la Svizzera si trova nel cuore dell'Europa, \u00e8 perfettamente inserita nella rete dei trasporti, offre tutte le comodit\u00e0 di uno Stato occidentale e democratico e, fedele al suo profondo spirito democratico, si sforza di mantenere le migliori relazioni possibili con tutti i Paesi. Inoltre, le attivit\u00e0 di intelligence hanno un costo: nella discrezione della piazza finanziaria \u00e8 possibile sovvenzionare le operazioni e occultare l'origine dei fondi.",
                    "A Ginevra \u00e8 possibile preparare e portare a termine operazioni complesse. Grazie alle rivelazioni di Edward Snowden, ad esempio, si sa che gli Stati Uniti gestiscono a Ginevra uno Special Collection Service, una base di sorveglianza progettata per difficili operazioni di intercettazione. \u00c8 anche certo che nel 2015 Israele ha spiato i colloqui con l'Iran sul nucleare. In citt\u00e0 anche i servizi segreti francesi sono tradizionalmente attivi: negli anni Cinquanta vi hanno perfino orchestrato tentativi di assassinio.",
                    "Il rapporto del SIC esamina principalmente le attivit\u00e0 di spionaggio di Russia, Cina e Iran, sia perch\u00e9 rappresentano minacce attuali, sia perch\u00e9 non si vogliono mettere troppo sotto la lente le attivit\u00e0 degli Stati partner. Il SIC fa una distinzione interessante: la Russia pratica uno spionaggio \"classico\", diretto contro altri Stati, mentre Cina e Iran agiscono principalmente contro la propria diaspora.",
                    "H\u00e4nni, tuttavia, non \u00e8 del tutto d'accordo con questa valutazione: \"\u00c8 difficile fare una distinzione netta. Lo spionaggio russo \u00e8 certamente diretto anche contro la cittadinanza russa. E la Cina, in particolare, ha ampliato negli ultimi anni le sue attivit\u00e0 di spionaggio in modo massiccio\". L'aumento delle operazioni di influenza \u00e8 evidente: si tenta di orientare l\u2019opinione pubblica in Occidente.",
                    "Nel rapporto del SIC si pu\u00f2 inoltre leggere: \"\u00c8 molto probabile che i servizi di intel\u00adligence cinesi si servano maggiormente di coperture non diplomatiche rispetto a quelli russi\", vale a dire che si affidano a persone attive nel mondo accademico, nei media o nelle ONG.",

                    "Secondo H\u00e4nni, le espulsioni renderanno sempre pi\u00f9 difficile per i servizi russi operare in Europa. Si aspetta quindi che la Russia si affidi sempre pi\u00f9 a \"illegali\": negli ultimi mesi ne sono stati scoperti in diversi Stati europei.",
                    "In generale, rivelare una spia \u00e8 una questione di ponderazione di interessi: le relazioni bilaterali possono essere turbate e bisogna sempre aspettarsi ritorsioni; ad esempio, l'anno scorso la Russia ha espulso anche numerosi diplomatici europei.",
                    "Secondo H\u00e4nni la sfida pi\u00f9 grande \u00e8 tuttavia in un altro ambito, un po\u2019 trascurato dal rapporto del SIC: la Svizzera potrebbe essere sfruttata per eludere le sanzioni. Anche questo \u00e8 nel solco della tradizione: \"Durante la Guerra fredda la Svizzera ha svolto un ruolo chiave nel trasferimento di tecnologia dall'Ovest all'Est\".",
                    "Le modalit\u00e0 possono essere diverse: societ\u00e0 di facciata che, sotto la direzione di un servizio segreto, commerciano o accumulano conoscenze; personale reclutato da aziende tecnologiche locali; talvolta perfino normali transazioni commerciali di aziende locali in buona fede con le merci che poi raggiungono la Russia attraverso Paesi terzi.",
                    "L'imposizione di sanzioni ha causato in Russia problemi con i prodotti industriali. Il Paese \u00e8 tecnologicamente avanzato, ma dipende dalle importazioni dall'Occidente, soprattutto per i prodotti di alta gamma. Attualmente, questi sono spesso importati attraverso altri Paesi, aggirando in qualche modo le sanzioni.",
                    "Si prevede quindi che la Russia ampli le sue attivit\u00e0 di spionaggio politico ed economico. Secondo H\u00e4nni, se fosse per il SIC, la Svizzera metterebbe fine alla sua passivit\u00e0 e inizierebbe a espellere. Ma il Governo resta nel solco della tradizione e mantiene la sua linea di cautela.",

                "en_content": "In the spring of 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, about 500 members of the Russian diplomatic corps were expelled from European states, all suspected of espionage. One of the only countries that did not decree expulsions was Switzerland.\nAccording to the\nof the Information Service of the Confederation (SIC), in the Russian diplomatic and consular representations of Bern and Geneva work about 220 people, of which \"it is very likely that at least one third is active for Russian intelligence services\".\nIn most European countries, the new comparison between the West and the East is making the work of Russian espionage networks increasingly difficult. \"In Switzerland, however, it is very likely that Russian intelligence services have a wider margin of manoeuvre due to their great presence,\" the SIC recognizes in full transparency.\nThis opening reflects how official Switzerland treats espionage networks in the country. Intelligence services are prohibited if they collect political, economic and military information at the expense of Switzerland, its institutions, its businesses and people residing there and transmit it to foreign actors.\nIn practice it is difficult to intervene: the accredited diplomatic staff, who are often entrusted with these activities, enjoys immunity and can hardly be pursued. The possibility of expulsion remains, but Switzerland almost never makes use of.\n\"It is in Switzerland's diplomatic DNA to expel diplomats only in rare exceptional cases\", says the historian specializing in secret services\n. We do not want to take the risk of irritation at a diplomatic level, especially since it is not even said that we could keep the phenomenon under control: \"If a spy is expelled, it usually comes simply another.\"\nFor counter-spionage, when a spy turns out, it is sometimes more profitable to monitor it, rather than to intervene publicly. Of course, this is also known by all States that have removed Russian diplomats and diplomats. \"These expulsions also represent a political signal,\" explains H\u00e4nni. \"However, since February 2022, some European states have expelled in a very targeted way intelligence officials essential to the activities of the espionage bases in embassies. In some cases, their places were immediately suppressed, so that Moscow could no longer employ them with new spies.\"\nSwitzerland adheres to its tradition of staying passive in these matters, at least in public. \"It is to be assumed that, when someone gets too much hands, behind the scenes Switzerland complains with the respective state,\" says H\u00e4nni.\nIn any case, the authorities already have a lot of experience in this area: espionage has been practiced in Geneva since World War I. Today, the city on Lemano hosts almost 240 foreign representations, dozens of international organizations, hundreds of NGOs.\nIt is therefore in the nature of the things that there are also many agents. Geneva is today considered one of the three crossroads of espionage in Europe, along with Brussels and Vienna.\nDuring the Cold War, Vienna was considered the \"city of spies\": The presence of international organizations, neutrality and geographical position also played a central role here. For a long time, in Austria the diplomatic staff working for secret services was treated as in Switzerland: he had a free hand.\nBut last year there was a turning point: Austria joined the EU states and expelled several people. In this way the Austrian authorities reacted to the harsh accusations that had been directed to her to be too profuse and sometimes to entertain direct collaborations with Russian organs.\nVienna hosts many important organizations, including the United Nations (UN), the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA), the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).\nBut other factors play a role: Switzerland is located in the heart of Europe, it is perfectly inserted in the transport network, offers all the comforts of a Western and democratic State and, faithful to its deep democratic spirit, strives to maintain the best possible relations with all countries. In addition, intelligence activities have a cost: in the discretion of the financial square it is possible to subsidize operations and conceal the origin of funds.\nIn Geneva you can prepare and complete complex operations. Thanks to Edward Snowden's revelations, for example, it is known that the United States manages a Special Collection Service in Geneva, a surveillance base designed for difficult interception operations. It is also certain that in 2015 Israel has paved the talks with Iran on nuclear power. French secret services are also traditionally active in the city: in the 1950s there have even orchestrated assassination attempts.\nThe SIC report mainly examines the espionage activities of Russia, China and Iran, both because they represent current threats, and because they do not want to put too much under the lens the activities of the partner states. The SIC makes an interesting distinction: Russia practices a \"classical\" espionage, directed against other states, while China and Iran act mainly against its diaspora.\nH\u00e4nni, however, does not entirely agree with this assessment: \"It is difficult to make a clear distinction. Russian intelligence is certainly also directed against Russian citizenship. And China, in particular, has expanded its espionage activities in the last few years.\" The increase in influence operations is evident: we try to direct public opinion in the West.\nIn the SIC report you can also read: \"It is very probable that Chinese intelligence services are more used than non-commercial coverage than the Russian ones,\" i.e. relying on people active in the academic world, the media or NGOs.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1960s, Switzerland became the heart of a global Chinese espionage network.\nFor the latter, we are talking about \"illegal\" in the face of the \"legal\" who carry out their espionage activities under diplomatic cover: already the use of terms shows how espionage is faced with pragmatism.\nAccording to H\u00e4nni, expulsions will make it increasingly difficult for Russian services to operate in Europe. It is therefore expected that Russia increasingly suffers to \"illegal\": In recent months they have been discovered in several European states.\nIn general, revealing a spy is a question of weighting interests: bilateral relations can be disturbed and retaliation must always be expected; For example, last year Russia also expelled many European diplomats.\nAccording to H\u00e4nni the biggest challenge is, however, in another area, somewhat neglected by the SIC report: Switzerland could be exploited to evade sanctions. This is also in the groove of tradition: \"During the Cold War Switzerland played a key role in technology transfer from the West to the East.\"\nThe modes can be different: facade society that, under the direction of a secret service, trade or accumulate knowledge; staff recruited by local technological companies; sometimes even normal business transactions of local companies in good faith with goods that then reach Russia through third countries.\nThe imposition of sanctions has caused in Russia problems with industrial products. The country is technologically advanced, but depends on imports from the West, especially for high-end products. Currently, these are often imported through other countries, somehow bypassing sanctions.\nRussia is expected to expand its political and economic espionage activities. According to H\u00e4nni, if it were for SIC, Switzerland would end its liabilities and begin expelling. But the government remains in the groove of tradition and maintains its line of caution.\nOther developments\n\nSwitzerland carries out a dangerous game of balancing with the EU from which it could be defeated.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

                "en_content": "In SWI swissinfo.ch, people from 15 different countries work in Bern. Our journalists and journalists with an international background deal every day in Switzerland. In many cases they have been living in the country for decades, but they continue to follow what happens in countries where they have grown. Six of them tell what makes Swiss elections particularly exciting, if you observe taking into account the situation in another country: Japan, United States, Tunisia, Russia, China and Mexico.\nNational political elections in Switzerland are held every four years. The international media generally devote little attention to it, because in the very stable political system of the Confederation electoral weight changes are usually very limited. Would the Swiss elections deserve more attention?\n\"The instruments of direct democracy deprive us legislators of a part of power, because we know that the people have the last word. In this way, in Switzerland we pulverize power,\" said a Swiss MP long ago to my question and two other Mexican journalists on the functioning of the Swiss political system.\nIn fact, the election results in Switzerland are not a sign of blind trust in the new government after the elections. The right of veto of citizenship to legislative decisions is a constant fact: the recurrent votes on popular initiatives and referendums allow the electorate to express itself on the decisions of the Federal Parliament or to propose constitutional changes.\nI'm from Mexico. Over 25 years ago I contacted some Mexican media because I wanted to work as a correspondent from Switzerland. \"Swiss policy is boring,\" was the answer. It is a matter of perspective: it is true that the Swiss elections cannot be summed up in a competition between two or three leading politicians. But this is also one of the reasons that make the analysis of the Swiss system interesting: the figure of the president or the president of the Confederation has little importance, unlike Mexico.\nAfter the Swiss political elections, Parliament elects the federal government. It is a college of seven members, belonging to the strongest parties. The formula shows that Switzerland attaches great importance to consent; political power is distributed over many shoulders. This is perhaps one of the reasons why not in Switzerland everyone knows the names of the members of the government and often ignores the president. Also because the latter, which has a function mainly representative, is assumed in turn by the members of the government.\nThis is also an important index of the division of political power, a factor that makes the Swiss political system so different from that of a country like Mexico, where politics increasingly resembles a telenovela.\n\nSwitzerland is a small modest country, where it is thought that the federal democratic system is so complicated to be in any case impossible to explain to foreign people. From this comes a paradox: the parliamentary elections in Switzerland \u2013 a country in the center of Europe, in the foreground in economic globalization, financial center and world banking, home to many international organizations, equipped with a powerful military-industrial complex \u2013 are usually done without the fact that in the world it takes note. The names of leading figures in Swiss politics are almost unknown abroad.\nLet us try to change this situation and at the same time explain why things are like this: in Switzerland the traditional instruments of representative democracy exist in parallel to the instruments of direct democracy. Does the Swiss parliamentary elections not involve major changes? This depends on the fact that in Switzerland things do not change every four years, but literally every day. The reason is the frequent votes at various levels \u2013 Confederation, Cantons and Municipalities. Perhaps the most important teaching is that in Switzerland, a country of direct democracy, the electoral result of a party is not decisive!\nMore importantly, the daily work of the parties between two electoral appointments at all levels of the federalist, municipal, cantonal and federal system. Thanks to the instruments of popular initiative and referendum, in Switzerland the victory in parliamentary elections does not allow parties to do the good and bad time in the following four years. The day after the elections the parties are required to propose solutions to the people for concrete problems, addressing the electorate with bills and popular initiatives. These proposals are often submitted to the popular vote and yesterday\u2019s winners can suffer tomorrow\u2019s hearty defeat on one question or another.\nThe concept of \"silver democracy\" has long emerged in Japan. In the face of the ageing population and the poor participation of young people, the elections put in the foreground a \"politics of the oldest decided by the oldest for the elderly\", which makes it easier for politicians of a certain age and the old parties to win and implement their political programme. As social security costs weigh on public finances, reforms aiming to reduce expenditure in favour of older people are postponed, while only taxes and premiums for health insurance are increasing on younger people. Young people do not have prospects for the future and the birth rate decreases further. A vicious circle.\nIn Switzerland I see little concern for a possible evolution of democracy in this direction. In this year\u2019s election campaign, the Socialist Party demands an extension of the offer of care for children, while the largest party, the Central Democratic Union (right conservative), is strongly opposed. In the polls dedicated to the most important issues in view of the elections, health insurance premiums, immigration and pension reform are in the first place. Family policy is not even an option.\nWhat is the reason for this disinterest in family policy? Is the low birth rate not an important issue for Switzerland, which at the same time attracts migrants seeking higher wages, a better standard of living and a more stable political and economic climate? In Switzerland, where the last word on many political issues is a popular vote, does it not matter to send people to Parliament who care about the needs of youth? These questions remain open.\nBut I have the feeling that Switzerland is taking the risk of becoming a silver democracy. With a percentage of 19.2% in 2022, the share of older people on the total population is significantly lower than in Japan (29.1%). 26% of people over 18 years living in Switzerland are of foreign nationality and have no right to vote. The ageing of the electorate in its own sense is much more marked, reaching 23.1%, almost the same level reached by Japan in 2010.\nCan Switzerland avoid slipping into the state of silver democracy? If the answer was yes, it could again provide a positive model to all developed countries where society ages.\nI always become nostalgic when I think of the first time I could vote for the election of a Parliament at the age of 22! It was not the first elections in my country, Tunisia, but it was the first free, democratic and transparent elections. So I joyfully immersed my finger in the indelible electoral ink and shared the photo on social media. It wasn't just a political exercise, it was a party! I felt the weight of this historic moment, when I handed over my ballot, knowing to contribute to a democratic process on which my generation's hopes were met with those of previous generations. Today I live in Switzerland I would absolutely like to be able to participate in the democratic process.\nA quarter of the Swiss adult population, however, including me, cannot participate in Parliament elections. Federal votes of October 2023 approach and\n, they will not receive the voting material. On a national scale only\n. Someone might wonder why foreigners and foreigners should be interested in the Swiss elections. Apart from the obvious finding that I work as a journalist in Switzerland, my answer to the question looks beyond national borders. The importance of these elections and what will be perceived in the families of migrants, men and women, wherever they are. The political orientation of Switzerland, decided in Parliament, can determine the future of these families and even the fate of thousands of people \u2013 particularly in the context of issues such as migration and international cooperation. Here is the core of the global importance of Switzerland: It is not just internal policy, but also the consequences of this policy on people\u2019s lives abroad.\nAlthough I cannot vote at the moment, I follow the elections very carefully. Today, finding me outside this democratic arena, I do what the excluded often do: I hope to participate one day in the democratic dance.\nIn Switzerland the parties have a completely different role than that of the single party in China.\nAlready in the preamble of the Chinese Constitution, the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China (PCC) is given a more prominent position than the \"Omnipotent God\" in the preamble of the Swiss Federal Constitution. While Article 1 of the Swiss Constitution lists the 26 cantons, which form together the \"Switzerland Confederation \", Article 1 of the Chinese Constitution clarifies that the socialist system is the basis of the People's Republic of China and the leading role of the Communist Party is the determining feature of Chinese socialism.\nThe office of secretary general of the CCP is the absolute center of power in China, while the power of the secretariats and the presidents of the Swiss parties depends on their ability to convince the electorate. The legal position of parties in Switzerland is quite weak. Only since 1999 there has been a brief article dedicated to them in the Federal Constitution (Article 137): \"The parties participate in the formation of popular opinion and will.\" In any case in Switzerland there is never talk of the state\u2019s relations with the party in the singular, but always in the plural, because there is a lively pluralism of the partisan. In Parliament there are 11 parties, four of them also sit in the Government, called the Federal Council.\nIn Switzerland, the landscape is constantly changing. The parties go and come, some merge or change their name \u2013 and of course there are those who remain. All parties must constantly impose themselves on the market of political concepts and conquer their share in terms of votes. They must convince the electorate with proposals for solutions to the problems and demands of the population. Electricians and voters have the power to decide and can sometimes be ruthless when they are not satisfied with the performance of a party.\nThe United States and Switzerland have many things in common. Both countries are proud of their democracies and their right to vote deeply rooted. More and more have something else in common: increasing polarization.\nIn the United States \"no forum [appear] too small or too sleepy to be polarized\", wrote a few years ago the magazine\n. In the last decade, a mentality based on a clear distinction between \"we and them\" has caused very dark clouds over the USA, clouds that creep into almost all aspects of existence \u2013 from the classrooms of parliament to\n. Such an extreme situation has long seemed far away from Switzerland, especially thanks to a political system based on consensus and plurality of parties: Switzerland has six main parties and a dozen smaller formations fighting to grab seats in Parliament.\nHowever, there are signs of increasing polarization in Switzerland. A\nrecently indicated that in the country many people fear the fragmentation of society in smaller groups divided by unconcilable positions. As a Swiss friend told me: \"Everything looks white or black today. \"\nSome say pandemic was\nfor Switzerland. The debates on the measures to contain the Covid would draw up new and more net division lines between the different social groups.\nIt is not only a matter of individual laws and concrete positions on specific issues \u2013 different views are normal in a democratic society. In both countries today's polarization is emotional and is linked to a growing intolerance towards people who profess different opinions. While the themes on which the minds are divided change from one country to another \u2013 in the USA the theme of abortion is for example much more divisive than in Switzerland \u2013 in both counted countries that people judge very quickly the character of others only according to their political opinions.\nSwitzerland has not yet reached the extremes of the United States, however the growing polarization in a country by many parties and\n.\nOther developments\n\nA milestone in vacilla democracy. Who protects freedom of expression?\nPolarization is not good for countries and democracies. Makes people stop discussing each other and close in their bubble, preventing debate and development of new ideas.\nPolarization can also push people away from politics. If the electorate sees that politics is increasingly emphasizing the reasons of division rather than seeking solutions, it is likely that you are looking for answers elsewhere or retreating into your field, aggravating the problem.\nCompared to federal elections, the way Switzerland is facing a polarized policy can be a signal for the United States and for democracies around the world.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nElectoral campaigns in Switzerland are not as boring as they generally think abroad, says historian Zo\u00e9 Kergomard.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

                "en_content": "More than 120,000 jobs were vacant in Switzerland at the end of 2022, a figure never seen since 2003 \u2013 the first year for which the figures of the Federal Statistical Office (UST) are available. The phenomenon does not concern only the Confederation: Three out of four companies in the world report recruitment difficulties, according to the ManpowerGroup placement giant.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nWith more than 100,000 vacancies registered in the first quarter of 2022, the shortage of labour has reached new records in Switzerland.\nRestoration, hotel, industry, computer science, construction, health, logistics: the list of professional sectors that seek desperately personal is long and varied. \"All economic sectors are now competing to attract the same qualifications. If you have skills in computer science or are leading you have the embarrassment of choice in your search for employment,\" says Stefan Studer of the Employ\u00e9s Suisses / Angestellte Schweiz.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nWorkers and workers, waiters and waiters, nurses and nurses as well as computer and computer: here are some of the most requested professions.\nThe strong post-Pandemia economic recovery partly explains these difficulties in recruitment. In some areas of activity, especially the liberal-rector and health, pandemic has also highlighted difficult working conditions, which push many people to reorient themselves towards other professions.\nThe situation could, however, be just a glimpse of the challenges with which the employers in Switzerland will be confronted in the future. Due to the ageing of the population and the departure towards the retirement of the \"baby boomer\" generation, the labour market will face major upheavals in the coming years.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nPopulation aging and changing lifestyles are turning the labour market in Switzerland.\nWith an unemployment rate at the lowest level for 20 years, a strong demand for labour and the total revocation of health restrictions, it is not surprising that immigration has grown again. \"Switzerland is one of the most attractive countries in Europe for migrants seeking work,\" says Philippe Wanner, professor at the Institute of socio-economic demographics at the University of Geneva, \"and these people are successful on this demanding labour market, but offering higher wages in European comparison.\"\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nUnemployment in Switzerland has never been so low for 20 years. Immigration, especially from neighbouring countries, is a big career.\nActive people coming from the EU/EFA area have easy access to the Swiss labour market. They benefit from the agreement on free movement of persons. The competition to attract skilled labour from other European countries is becoming increasingly intense.\nFor example, it is the case in the health sector: hospitals actively launch into recruitment campaigns abroad to cope with the shortage of \"white shirts\". \"But in Poland it is difficult to find qualified personnel willing to move to Switzerland,\" says Grazyna Scheiwiller, Carenea, a company specialized in recruiting workers in Poland.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe shortage of qualified personnel forces Swiss hospitals to look beyond the end. A change is not in sight.\nFor non-European people seeking work, access to the Swiss labour market remains very limited. From third countries (outside the EU/EFA) only highly qualified personnel are allowed. Companies wishing to hire labour from these countries must demonstrate that they have not found a person with corresponding qualifications in Switzerland or in the EU/EFA area. Moreover, this type of admission must be in the interest of Switzerland and the economy. The number of work permits for persons originating in third countries is limited by quotas.\n\n\n\n\nGetting a residence and work permit in Switzerland depends on many factors, including skills and provenance.\nDespite the record vacancy rate, the question of whether immigrants occupy jobs that could be covered by Swiss nationals remains politically controversial. The impact of immigration on infrastructure and the environment is regularly criticized by a part of the political spectrum. The conservative right made it one of its main issues of electoral campaign in view of the federal laws of 22 October.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland's rapid population growth will be a hot topic of the campaign in view of the October federal elections.\nDue to the tensions around immigration, other solutions are proposed to try to reduce the shortage. Economic circles want to exploit the potential of indigenous labour, first of all women. Approximately six out of ten women perform part-time employment \u2013 a nearly record rate in Europe.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe lack of qualified personnel has become the main concern of Swiss companies. Monica Dell'Anna illustrates the solutions.\nThere are also other \"lives\" of labour within the population: and young people, older people, refugee people or those who feel social aid. The Conference of Social Action Institutions (CSIAS) and the Swiss Federation for Continuous Education (FSEA) have recently launched a training campaign for people benefiting from social assistance. So far, the priority was given to professional reintegration. \"Experience shows that the improvement of skills allows to make integration in the labour market more durable. It is a paradigm shift in the sector,\" explains FSEA president Matthias Aebischer.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe institutions active in social aid want to encourage reintegration into the labour market by focusing on continuing training.\nThe rarity of labor is a manna from the sky also for all people already assumed in a company. They have the knife on the side of the handle in wage negotiations. With a strong relationship that moves in favor of the waged and those who represent them, collective demands could gain more momentum in the future.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe shortage of labour could favour the unions and staff in the wage negotiations of this autumn. Interview.\nThis innovation increasingly stimulates the desire for professional mobility, especially in younger generations. Although the scale of the phenomenon does not yet correspond to the \"Great Resignation\" observed in the United States or the United Kingdom, companies are however obliged to change the organizational and cultural route of 180\u00b0 to attract \u2013 and keep \u2013 young talents.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nIn a context of labor shortages, young talents and young people take advantage of their strong position towards companies.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

In 2010, the Swiss National Science Fund (\n) launched the National Research Centre (\n) robotics, the first of its kind in engineering sciences.\nAfter 12 years and about 85 million francs invested, the funding will end in November 2022. What will be the result? Today, the most popular robots are not produced in Switzerland, but in Japan, Korea, China, Germany or the United States. However, Switzerland is a world leader in research and products developed in Swiss start-ups are on the market.\nAude Billard, head of the Laboratory of algorithms and learning systems (\n) at the Federal Polytechnic of Lausanne (\n), also directs the new\nin robotics, which will promote the transfer of knowledge and the transition to the industrial phase.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThis is where tomorrow's robots, flexible, agile, collaborative and intelligent as a machine can be.\nFor some products, this phase is already very advanced. It is the case of drones, especially professional ones. It is a field in which Swiss brands are among the most established in the world, as demonstrated by this rapid overview of 2018.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland is a leader in drone research and development. More and more often we talk about a \"drone valley\", strip of land among the Polytechnics. . .\nAnd why stop at the traditional drone helicopter? Smart Systems Laboratory (\n) of the EPFL is developing a bird-shaped drone. Thanks to its wings, it consumes much less energy and can therefore fly far longer than a conventional drone with only one charge of the battery. It also has claws, which allow it to collect objects and to lay on a wire, like those of electricity, to recharge the battery.\nProfessor Dario Floreano, director of the LIS laboratory, also directed the NCCR Robotics for 12 years. Floreano opened his workshop doors at SWI swissinfo.ch.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nA helicopter drone is agile and handy, but a bird drone can fly longer and pose almost anywhere.\nThese drones aren't toys. However, they are not yet able to deliver goods or save people, for example. At the moment, they are mainly used to see what escapes the human eye, which can be valuable in areas such as agriculture.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nIntelligent agriculture allows you to integrate advanced technologies such as robotics in the daily management of farms.\nToday, no one imagines to come across an android similar to the C-3PO of Star Wars or a Terminator, not even in the lab. If the humanoid robot is still a distant dream, there are those who managed to develop similar to animals, equipped with those appendices so precious to reach any place: the legs. In this field, American machines\nare particularly impressive.\nIn Switzerland research has not yet reached this point, but a start-up in Zurich already offers a kind of robotic dog, able to move in difficult environments, such as rescue missions following a disaster or bombing.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe September 11 attacks bare the need for better robotic technologies to prevent and mitigate disasters.\nAlthough today's robots are not yet able to extract a person from rubble, they can do much for our health. The application of medical robotics has been supported by numerous projects within the NCCR.\nThe achievements range from robotic prostheses to exoskeletals designed to restore the mobility of people with disabilities, and even to robot- surgeons\nIn one of our newsletters, we met a pioneer in the industry.\n\n\n\n\nFrom semi-autonomous \u201crobot-chirurghi\u201d to bioengineered skin tissues, some of the most promising medical innovations come from Switzerland.\nThere is also the robot-teacher, promoted by pandemic and distance learning. But here everyone agrees: One day he can be an assistant, but not a teacher.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nCan robots assume tasks in distance and classroom teaching? Experts see potential, but also dangers.\nBecause even if it is agile, fearless and fast, if it sees better and calculates faster than us, a robot does not have the intelligence of a human. Its intelligence is artificial - which makes the difference. So far, no artificial intelligence system has passed the Turing test, which was invented 70 years ago and consists of a computer pretending to be a human in a simple blind conversation.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nComputers often make important decisions for us. Should we let them do it? Perhaps not: intelligence in machines is just an illusion.\nThis is the situation of robotics in Switzerland today. Promise or disappointing? Everything depends on the point of view.\nWhat is certain, however, is that this sector is advancing rapidly. To realize this, just read this article in 2010, when we visited a certain Dario Floreano, then just named head of what was then called the National Robotic Research Centre.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

                "en_content": "Even before the election result was known, the online portals of Tamedia newspapers had already called it \"historical\".\nAccording to the projections, the UDC conquered its second best result ever after that of 2015, while the Greens recorded a collapse of four points after the success of four years ago.\nBut as some people paint the election day as a historian, the end of the election campaign did not record results: in the last period, the Swiss elections did not have a particularly important media coverage.\nSwiss federal elections are not known for major upheavals: Sometimes you have to look for the drama with the magnifying glass. Since the beginning of the Israeli-Palestinian war, the interest of the public has definitely shifted to the world situation. However, the coverage of the Swiss elections was perhaps even a little dismayed because, unlike four years ago, in the elections of 2023 there was no dominant theme during the election campaign.\nCentral democratic union \u2013 right conservative\nSocialist Party \u2013 Left\nRadical Liberal Party \u2013 Right\n: centre\n: Swiss ecologist party (Verdi) \u2013 left\nLiberal Green Party \u2013 Center\nIn the election and referendum campaigns, the Ann\u00e9e Politique Suisse platform also evaluates the coverage of newspapers according to scientific criteria. How often did such or such other party appear? What theme did the election campaign dominate? In the 4'106 newspaper articles analysed over eight weeks, a wide range of topics emerged: \"Health Insurance, Health\" was the most frequent topic, but also banks, transport, energy, migration and climate were present, write Anja Heidelberger and Marc B\u00fchlmann in their analysis.\nUnlike the 2019 elections, which are remembered as \"climate elements\" and \"elections of women\", and the 2015 elections, where, in view of the high figures relating to asylum, the migration coverage dominated everything, in 2023 you can not talk about \"mainly monothematic media coverage\".\nSwiss elections are mobilization elections. The low turnout to the polls (46.9% of people entitled to vote) compared to international standards makes the result depend much on which party can more mobilize its base. Marc B\u00fchlmann, director of Ann\u00e9e Politique Suisse, explains to swissinfo.ch the interaction between the media and the campaign: \"In Switzerland, with its low turnout at the polls, the question of those who manage to mobilize their base is central in each election campaign. Four years ago, when the Greens were seen by the movement for climate as a party capable of solving environmental problems, this has more mobilized their electorate.\"\nToday the party has had less success in using the climate issue to its advantage. When we talk about climate policy, for example in relation to activists and activists who stick to a road and block traffic, this does not help the Greens.\nAnn\u00e9e Politique Suisse also analyzes the frequency with which the parties appear on the media. The UDC, as a stronger party, is quoted more often. They follow PS, PLR and Center.\nHowever, minor parties are sub-represented against the four government parties: \"The total share of the electorate of these parties is 10.1%, but the share of articles in the media is only 3.4%\", reads in the analysis.\nAlthough parties are also present on social media, B\u00fchlmann considers these instruments negligible. \"Great part of the electorate is made up of middle-aged people who do not use social media to obtain information,\" B\u00fchlmann says, while recognizing that parties use social media as mobilization channels. But \"at the moment it might be rather difficult to conquer new voters and electrics through this channel or convince them.\"\nThe Politransparency platform shows that the PS has invested more in advertising on Facebook and Instagram with 429'100 francs. Following the PLR, the Centre, the Liberal Greens and the Greens. The UDC invested only 112,000 francs in this field.\nHowever, a viral video of the UDC on Instagram has reached 300,000 people - more than any other video published by a party account on this channel.\nAccording to B\u00fchlmann, however, traditional newspapers and media remain fundamental. \"Being on the media helps, is a mobilization,\" says B\u00fchlmann. \"It would be too easy to conclude that a party wins because there is much coverage. The fact that a party is still important. But if this coverage is positive or negative is certainly not decisive.\"\nOther developments\n\nA milestone in vacilla democracy.

During the traditional end-day television debate, his president\nwas modest: \"We have received a clear mandate from the people to put on the table important issues, such as illegal immigration and its consequences, and a secure energy supply,\" he said.\nIn the second place, the Socialist Party (PS) was satisfied with the results, in particular in French Switzerland, where \"they are rather impressive\", according to the co-president\n. For the first time in eight years, the PS has slightly progressed at national level, earning two seats. \"It is clear that the people gave us the mandate to counterweight the UDC,\" he said.\nThe presidents of the ecologist parties expressed their obvious disappointment, since the number of votes obtained is in sharp decline. \"We maintain the two-thirds of our seats in Parliament, while the UDC recovered only two-thirds of the seats lost in 2019,\" he said.\nPresident of the Greens. The party lost five seats in the National Council and its electoral force fell under 10%. The Liberal Green Party (PVL) has lost six seats.\nWhile 2019 saw an unprecedented green wave, 2023 disappointed the hopes of many ecologist candidates and candidates. For everyday life in French language\nThe Greens have lost their moralist discourse on climate, gender issues and meat consumption. The\nwrites that the actions of activists and climate activists have had a negative impact on the result of the ecologist party.\nIn this context of price increase and instability of the global geopolitical situation, the parties who have focused on daily concerns, such as the UDC, which has focused much of its migration campaign.\nDuring the television debate, Marco Chiesa repeatedly insisted on Swiss asylum policy and immigration of thousands of workers each year, stating that they are the cause of many of the country's ills. These themes clearly crossed the electorate.\nWith the new composition of Parliament, the economic daily\nfears a lack of pragmatism. Responding with a reassuring but simplistic rhetoric to the concerns of the population in the face of real problems - such as those caused by immigration - can certainly help to get elected, observe\n. The task of a parliamentarian continues to respond to the challenges facing Switzerland.\nFor the President of the Radical Liberal Party (PLR)\nThe question of asylum has gained importance during the election campaign. \"If we don't want the UDC to gain even more ground in four years, we have to deal with the matter seriously,\" he warned. The liberal right-wing party obtained 14.6% of votes, losing 0.5 percentage points.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland renewed its Parliament on Sunday. Here are the results for the elections of the National Council and the Council of States.\nThe increase in health costs, in particular health insurance premiums (health insurance), was another of the main issues of the election campaign.\nIn this context, the PS \"does not expect the support of the right-wing parties and will launch a new initiative for a unique sick case\". But according to C\u00e9dric Wermuth, \"the discussions with all parties are always possible\" to find solutions.\nAn opinion shared by\nPresident of the Centre. According to him, the Swiss population sees its party and PS as the most competent in the field of health. \"Our goal is to stop rising costs. To achieve this, we will create alliances with parties that share some of our ideas,\" he said.\nBeyond this specific theme, the party presidents seemed prone to promoting a culture of compromise. \"We must find solutions that unite people,\" he said.\n, Vice-President of the PVL, for which the ecological transition and ageing of the population must become the priorities of Parliament. Balthasar Gl\u00e4ttli added: \"We must find a way to protect the climate even in this more difficult context, because the climate does not wait for anyone.\"\nThe daily\nbelieves that the good results of the UDC will force you to assume its responsibilities and to stop being just a party of opposition that blows on the arms and refuses to tighten really constructive alliances.\nWith the Centre au pair with the PLR as the third political force of the country, the question of the composition of the Federal Council was raised again.

A differenza dell'UDC, il PLR ha insistito sulla necessit\u00e0 di mantenere la libera circolazione delle persone per attirare in Svizzera una manodopera europea qualificata, insistendo al contempo sulla necessit\u00e0 di combattere il \"turismo sociale\" e il \"caos dell'asilo\".",

La causa principale dell'astensione potrebbe risiedere nell'inerzia insita del sistema svizzero. L'avanzata del 3% di un partito \u00e8 considerata quasi un terremoto politico. I rapporti di potere rimangono per\u00f2 quasi sempre invariati. A maggior ragione nel Governo, un bastione di stabilit\u00e0.",

                    "La campagna elettorale \u00e8 stata ben lontana dai momenti di tensione politica e dagli attacchi d'antologia osservati in altri Paesi. I partiti hanno presentato i loro programmi basandosi sui loro temi prediletti, senza invadere troppo il territorio delle formazioni avversarie. Non ci sono stati nemmeno veri e propri dibattiti di fondo sulle principali questioni politiche del momento. Il crollo di Credit Suisse e le relazioni con l'Unione Europea sono state assenti dalla campagna elettorale.",
                    "Tuttavia, questa non \u00e8 un'eccezione, ma piuttosto la regola nella tranquilla Svizzera. A parte i vivi dibattiti sull'immigrazione nel 2015 e l'incidente nucleare di Fukushima nel 2011, le campagne sono spesso blande. Si tratta di una caratteristica intrinseca della democrazia diretta svizzera: con delle votazioni federali che si tengono quattro volte l'anno, i partiti hanno molte altre occasioni per spiegare le loro posizioni sui vari temi.",
                    "Resta il fatto che, come ogni quattro anni, questa campagna elettorale ha permesso ai partiti di creare un legame con il popolo. Ogni persona candidata ha dovuto dare s\u00e9 stessa e stringere centinaia, se non migliaia, di mani nella speranza di mantenere o conquistare un seggio a Berna. Un momento raro e prezioso, anche in una democrazia svizzera spesso definita un esempio di vicinanza tra la gente e chi la rappresenta.",
                    "Oltre 220'000 cittadini e cittadine di nazionalit\u00e0 svizzera residenti all'estero sono iscritti in un registro elettorale. La tendenza della diaspora elvetica \u00e8 che sempre pi\u00f9 persone fanno ritorno in patria. In questo senso, \u00e8 legittimo che partecipino a votazioni e a elezioni.",
                    "L'elettorato della Quinta Svizzera \u00e8 in rapida crescita. Negli ultimi 30 anni \u00e8 pi\u00f9 che triplicato e se fosse un Cantone avrebbe diritto a sei seggi nel Consiglio nazionale. I partiti si contendono quindi sempre pi\u00f9 i voti di chi vive all'estero. Il PS, l'UDC, il PLR e il Centro sono attivi da tempo presso la diaspora e dispongono di sezioni internazionali. Queste hanno gi\u00e0 consentito ad alcuni candidati di ottenere i voti necessari per accedere al Parlamento.",
                    "Il Partito verde liberale \u00e8 stato l'ultimo dei grandi partiti a creare una sezione internazionale pin vista di queste elezioni. Si tratta di un buon abbinamento, perch\u00e9 il profilo politico degli svizzeri e delle svizzere all'estero coincide in larga misura con quello dei Verdi Liberali: in media, sono progressisti in ambito ecologico, difendono una societ\u00e0 liberale e sono favorevoli a una politica estera aperta.",
                    "Poich\u00e9 l'elettorato all'estero vota\u00a0maggiormente in funzione dei valori, \u00e8 forse anche pi\u00f9 fedele\u00a0a un partito. Nell'anno elettorale 2023, \u00e8 cos\u00ec stato\u00a0al centro di numerosi interventi parlamentari. C'\u00e8 persino stato un vero e proprio sprint finale a favore della Quinta Svizzera.",

                "en_content": "Political ecology is no longer successful, neither in Switzerland nor elsewhere in Europe. The defeat of the Greens and the Liberal Green Party reflects the difficulties encountered by the ecologist parties within the European Union. In the polls, it is probable that they are also under arrest in the European elections of June 2024.\nDuring the 2019 election campaign, the climate and the environment had dominated the public debate and had caused great mobilization to the left of the political spectrum, especially with the organization of climate strikes. This year it wasn't like that.\nThe trend seems paradoxical, at a time when extreme weather events are rising and climate change continues to disturb many people in Switzerland. However, the fact that it is hot in October is not the main concern of the population, a growing part of which is struggling to arrive at the end of the month. Climate emergency may also generate a sense of impotence within the electorate.\nUltimately, ecologist formations failed to make climate change attractive. On the contrary, they have suffered because of the extreme actions carried out by the most radical climate movements, which provoke incomprehension and even anger in broad sections of the population.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nWith a gain of eight seats, the UDC will be the great winner of the federal elections, to the detriment especially of the Greens, according to the projections.\nThe images of the island of Lampedusa, compared with a huge influx of migrants from North Africa, have traveled the world and reported asylum policy in the foreground during this election year. A manna from the sky for the Central Democratic Union (UDC), which focused most of the electoral campaign on its favourite theme, the fight against immigration.\nWith the rise of asylum requests (12'188 between early January and late June, 43% more than 2022), which is added to the presence of 65'000 people sheltered from Ukraine, the UDC has been able to exploit the growing concerns of a part of the population.\nBy drawing the spectrum of a Switzerland with 10 million inhabitants on its posters, the UDC has not used terms, attracting the criticism of the Federal Commission against racism. The fact remains that this very clear message has had a mobilizing effect on the basis of the party in a period of international insecurity.\nThe UDC also found an ideal scapegoat in Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, the new socialist ministra responsible for immigration. This winning tactic, experienced many times in the past, has allowed the UDC to cancel the 2019 defeat and again approach the record result of 2015.\nWith the slogan \"Duro, but just\", the radical liberal party (PLR, liberal right) also made migration policy one of its priority issues during the electoral campaign. Unlike the UDC, the PLR insisted on the need to maintain free movement of persons to attract qualified European workers to Switzerland, while insisting on the need to fight social tourism and asylum caos.\nWith this position and surprisingly virulent attacks on Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, the PLR did not want to leave the field free to the right conservative on this theme. However, the electorate clearly gave more credit to the solutions proposed by the UDC.\nIn a period of full employment, the PLR has not been able to count on another strong theme of mobilization. Credit Suisse's mismanagement, detected by the rival UBS, has contributed to damage the party's image, historically closely linked to the Swiss financial centre.\nAs a result, the founding party of modern Switzerland has marched on the spot in these elections, without being able to reverse a decline that has long lasted. As in the early 1980s, the PLR now convinces a little more than one voter on seven.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland today renews its Parliament. Here are the screenings for the elections of the National Council and the Council of States.\nFor the election campaign of 2023, the Socialist Party returned to its origins: the struggle for the purchasing power of families. The return of inflation and the announcement of a new substantial increase in health insurance premiums (healthfall) a month before the federal elections have rekindled the spotlight on social issues. On the left, the PS managed to subtract some votes from the Greens.\nBut although health insurance premiums are again the main concern of the Swiss people, in front of immigration, the PS has benefited only marginally from the growing discontent of a part of the middle class electorate.\nUnlike the UDC on immigration and the Greens on global warming, the Socialist Party is not necessarily seen as the most competent political force in the overall health insurance sector.\nIn a country that relies heavily on individual freedom, the proposals of a single sick fund and income-based insurance premiums are considered by the majority of the electorate as an excessive state intervention. The PS is undoubtedly a prophet on the left, but continues to struggle to recruit beyond its traditional areas.\nAlthough it has not overwhelmed everything, it is still a historical moment for Swiss politics: The Centre is head to head with the PLR to become the third political force of the country. Depending on the final results in the two chambers, it may be mathematically entitled to a second seat in the Swiss Government (Federal Council). It is what the \"magic formula\" in force since 1959, according to which the three major parties hold each two seats in the national executive, and the fourth one only.\nWill the Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis, among the least popular federal advisers among the public, fear for his seat? Probably not, because according to another unwritten rule the councillors and federal councillors remain in office at least until the end of their mandate (there were only three exceptions in the last 175 years).\nThe same Democratic People's Party (PPD), from which the Centre was born, benefited from this principle four years ago, when it was exceeded for a few votes by the Greens. In 2021, the PPD joined the Democratic bourgeois party under a new name, finding some stability.\nOne thing is certain: in the current constellation, The Centre will be even more enterprising and will act as the main political force in the middle of political chess. Under the chairmanship of Gerhard Pfister, he freed his proverbial discretion. In the National Council, the most important coalition partner of the PLR and the UDC is confirmed, which together do not have the majority. In the Council of States, the main force should remain.\nSwitzerland, a model democracy, is tired of politics. With little less than 47%, turnout in 2023 was slightly higher than in 2019 (45.1%). However, as has always happened in recent decades, more than half of people with voting rights have not gone to the polls. And this at a time when crises do not hint at decreasing and purchasing power continues to shrink in Switzerland.\nWhat is the reason for this silence by the majority of the electorate? The main cause of abstention could reside in the inherent inertia of the Swiss system. The 3% advance of a party is considered almost a political earthquake. The relations of power remain almost always unchanged. Mostly in the government, a bastion of stability.\nAnd if Parliament, a little further on the left or a little further on the right, should make an unpleasant decision, those who are detained think they can call it to order with a referendum.\nThe election campaign was far from political tensions and anthology attacks observed in other countries. The parties presented their programmes based on their favourite themes, without overseeing the territory of the opposing formations. There have not even been real debates on the main political issues of the moment. Credit Suisse collapse and relations with the European Union were absent from the election campaign.\nHowever, this is not an exception, but rather the rule in quiet Switzerland. Apart from the live immigration debates in 2015 and the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011, campaigns are often blande. This is an intrinsic feature of Swiss direct democracy: with federal votes held four times a year, parties have many other opportunities to explain their positions on the various themes.\nThe fact remains that, like every four years, this election campaign has allowed parties to create a bond with the people. Each candidate had to give himself and hold hundreds, if not thousands, hands in the hope of maintaining or conquering a seat in Bern. A rare and precious moment, even in a Swiss democracy often called an example of closeness among people and those who represent it.\nMore than 220,000 Swiss nationals and citizens resident abroad are registered in an electoral register. The tendency of the Swiss diaspora is that more and more people return home. In this sense, it is legitimate to participate in votes and elections.\nThe Electorate of the Fifth Switzerland is growing rapidly. In the last 30 years it has more than tripled and if it were a canton it would be entitled to six seats in the National Council. The parties therefore increasingly contend with the votes of those who live abroad. The PS, the UDC, the PLR and the Centre have long been active at the diaspora and have international sections. These have already allowed some candidates to obtain the votes necessary to access Parliament.\nThe Liberal Green Party was the last of the great parties to create an international Pin view section of these elections. This is a good match, because the political profile of Swiss and Swiss abroad coincides with that of the Liberal Greens: On average, they are progressive in the ecological field, they defend a liberal society and are in favour of an open foreign policy.\nSince the electorate abroad votes more according to the values, it is perhaps even more faithful to a party. In the election year 2023, he was at the heart of many parliamentary interventions. There has even been a real final sprint for the Fifth Switzerland.\nOther developments\n\nA milestone in vacilla democracy.

Now he earned nine, so he didn't reach the same force as 2015.\nIf you sum up the right-wing deployments \u2013 UDC, PLR and minor parties \u2013 in the 2015-2019 legislature, they had a majority of 101 seats (out of 200) in the People's Chamber. They don't have it anymore.\nOverall, however, the political right has greatly strengthened compared to the last legislature: in the Canton of Geneva, the right-wing populist movement MCG has achieved excellent results, conquering two seats. In Ticino, the League managed to resist. The Federal Democratic Union has also earned a seat.\nYes, it certainly is. The Greens have lost less seats than we could expect on the basis of the percentage of votes. But there was not only a transfer of voters between the Greens and the PS (the Greens lost five seats, the Socialists earned two). Even the left extreme parties have lost the two seats obtained in the last legislature. Ultimately, the field of the left has weakened.\nCentral democratic union \u2013 right conservative\nSocialist Party \u2013 Left\nRadical Liberal Party \u2013 Right\n: centre\n: Swiss ecologist party (Verdi) \u2013 left\nLiberal Green Party \u2013 Center\nIt's hard to assess. But basically, in times of global crisis - when issues such as war, immigration and asylum become more important - nervousness and security need increase, even in Switzerland.\nAnd this traditionally strengthens right-wing movements, especially the UDC, which for years has been clearly positioned on these issues. It is the impression that this time the UDC has managed to mobilize its base better than the 2019 elections, when in a context characterized by the climatic question part of its electorate had simply remained at home. He has now been motivated to go back to the urns, in a more in line with his favorite concerns and themes.\nYes, this trend exists, at least in Europe, such as Germany, where several state elections have been held in recent weeks. Both AfD and CDU were able to earn money. Of course, dynamics are different, because with the system of government and opposition, government parties are often punished, regardless of who is in power. But fundamentally one can recognize a tendency: the strengthening of conservative forces.\nOther developments\nDebate\nHow do you read these results? Is the trend similar in the country where you live? Your opinion interests us.\nYou really have the impression that personalities are no longer so important. With Marco Chiesa, the party has a rather shaky president. Yet, she was able to get a great result. The UDC no longer depends on one person. There are several leaders who successfully managed this election campaign.\nThey managed to bring to the forefront their main themes, which had ample resonance in this foreign policy situation. However, Christoph Blocher continues to play a role behind the scenes as a financier.\nThis was one of the most interesting themes of pre-electoral months. It was unclear if you could simply sum the electoral quotas of PPD and PBD [the parties from which the Centre was born in 2020] and then get the final result of the Centre. But it went well, the name change and the fusion seem to have given the hoped fruits.\nThe Centre will probably be the need for the balance in the next Parliament because, as mentioned, the PLR and the UDC do not reach the majority in the National Council. There will be thematic coalitions and the party can choose whether and how to work with the right or with the left, depending on the theme. However, altogether the center field \u2013 which also includes the PVL and the Evangelical Party \u2013 has weakened, especially because of the backwardness of the liberal Greens, who have lost six seats.\nTraditionally, in the Council of States the Centre and PLR are strongly represented. The UDC and the PS, which are the two strongest parties in the National Council, are clearly underrepresented.\nThis is due to the fact that it is elections with the majority system, so it depends a lot on people, who must be able to win votes even outside their party. Parties with more marked positions have less success in this regard.\nOther developments\n\nA milestone in vacilla democracy. Who protects freedom of expression?\nAs regards the Council of States, there was a further weakening of the PS, but for now the situation is not so negative. For example, the party surprisingly gained a seat in Neuch\u00e2tel.\nIn other cantons you will have to wait for the results of the dancing. The starting positions are different. Overall, however, the UDC managed to maintain a relatively good position and could earn seats.\nIn essence, economic policy and liberal concerns have not been at the forefront of this election campaign. In this sense, the electorate did not have to place itself on these themes. These questions will probably have to be renegotiated later, when we have to give an answer to concrete and substantial issues in Parliament and, depending on cases, in votes.\nWe will then see whether the strengthening of the UDC will also reflect on these issues. It is not said that it will be so. Even in the past the UDC won elections, but it did not mean that the electorate followed it on some subsequent votes.\nPersonally, I find it a little sad that the female representation is falling. This is due to the fact that the UDC is practically the only party that has no candidate for more women in these elections. So it is normal that if you win, the percentage of women decreases accordingly.\nWe should keep an eye on this development, which was one of the main features of the 2019 elections. Gender equality played a minor role in this election campaign. Women's representation only succeeds if parties build and support female applications, which is not automatic\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to receive our articles.\nI do not expect any change as regards the Federal Council. It has been argued for a long time whether the Greens would have had the right to a seat, but for the moment there is a remote hypothesis.\nThe Centre remains. According to the magic formula - assuming that the four strongest parties are represented in the Federal Council with two seats each for the three largest and one seat for the smallest - the Center would be entitled to one of the two seats of the PLR.\nBut the Centre has already said that it will not obstruct the advisors and the federal advisors in charge. So the composition of the government will probably remain unchanged. The question will probably arise only in case of vacancy, when one of the two seats of the PLR will be released. I think then the Center could attack.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe right moves and the green wave belongs to the past: Here are the main lessons of this electoral Sunday.

                    "L'elettorato svizzero all'estero \u00e8 per\u00f2 tradizionalmente pi\u00f9 liberale e di sinistra rispetto al resto del Paese. \"Non \u00e8 una novit\u00e0, per questo non mi sorprende che l'UDC non abbia fatto pi\u00f9 breccia \" nella Quinta Svizzera, ha commentato la specialista.\u00a0",
                    "Nel complesso, il modo in cui la diaspora ha votato per queste elezioni legislative conferma la tendenza di questo elettorato a votare pi\u00f9 a sinistra e pi\u00f9 verde rispetto alla popolazione nazionale. All\u2019estero, i principali partiti di sinistra (PS e Verdi) hanno ottenuto quasi il 39% dei voti (rispetto al 27% dell'intera Svizzera); la forza combinata dei partiti ecologisti (Verdi e Verdi liberali) ha raggiunto il 30% all'estero (rispetto al 17% in Svizzera).\u00a0",
                    "I punteggi degli altri partiti rimangono relativamente stabili. Il Centro ha guadagnato 0,9 punti percentuali, avvicinandosi all'aumento di 0,8% ottenuto a livello nazionale. Anche per il Partito liberale radicale la tendenza \u00e8 stata pi\u00f9 o meno la stessa tra gli elettori e le elettrici espatriate rispetto al resto della Svizzera: il partito di destra ha perso 0,6 punti (rispetto agli 0,7 dell'intero Paese).\u00a0",
                    "Come spesso accade, l'affluenza alle urne della diaspora all'estero \u00e8 rimasta bassa: complessivamente \u00e8 stata del 18,7%, in calo in quasi tutti i cantoni tranne Basilea Citt\u00e0 e San Gallo. A livello nazionale, invece, \u00e8 aumentata leggermente rispetto al 2019, passando dal 45,1% al 46,6%.\u00a0",
                    "Alle elezioni federali si sono candidate 43 svizzere e svizzeri all'estero. Non sorprende che nessuna di queste candidature sia andata a buon fine. Tuttavia, si sono distinti i risultati di due membri della diaspora.\u00a0",
                    "Il candidato straniero che ha ottenuto il maggior numero di voti \u00e8 stato Pascal Cuttat, di Nairobi, nel Cantone di Berna. Ben 12\u2019451 bernesi hanno votato per il 61enne socialista, che lavora per la Croce Rossa Svizzera. Questo buon risultato rispetto ad altre candidature all'estero si spiega con il fatto che il suo nome era presente nella lista principale degli uomini socialisti bernesi. Cuttat, tuttavia, ha ottenuto il peggior risultato della sua lista.\u00a0",
                    "A Ginevra, il Verde Rudolf Berli ha avuto un grande successo. Con 11\u2019947 voti, \u00e8 arrivato quarto nella lista ecologista del Cantone. L'orticoltore di Pougny (Francia) ha ricevuto 4\u2019271 voti nella sola Ginevra e 999 dall'estero.\u00a0",
                    "L'ultima elezione di un consigliere nazionale dall'estero \u00e8 stata quella di Tim Guldimann per il PS nel Cantone di Zurigo. Nel 2015 ha ottenuto un risultato brillante, conquistando 102\u2019757 voti. All'epoca non era il primo svizzero all'estero a sedere in Parlamento, ma il primo a essere eletto mentre viveva fuori dai confini nazionali. Guldimann si \u00e8 dimesso nel 2018, sostenendo che era difficile \"vivere in un ambiente e fare politica in un altro\".\u00a0",
                    "In pratica, gli svizzeri e le svizzere all'estero hanno poche possibilit\u00e0 di essere eletti, sottolinea Ariane Rustichelli, direttrice dell'Organizzazione degli svizzeri all'estero (OSE). \"Il caso Guldimann \u00e8 stato del tutto eccezionale\", afferma.\u00a0",

                "en_content": "One of the main lessons to be drawn from the federal elections on Sunday 22 October is that the green wave that marked the 2019 legislative elections belongs to the past. At national level, the ecologist parties have undergone a real slap.\nWith 9.4% of the votes, the Greens fell by 3.8 points and lost 5 seats in the National Council (the lower chamber of Parliament). Only the other Green Party, the Liberal Greens, has further declined in terms of mandates (-6 seats and a decrease of 0.6 percentage points which led to 7.2%).\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland renewed its Parliament on Sunday. Here are the results for the elections of the National Council and the Council of States.\nSwiss and Swiss residents abroad also voted significantly less for the Greens this year. In all 12 cantons that provide separate statistics on the diaspora vote, the Green Party lost 5.4 points in terms of electoral share, descending from first place in 2019 (with 23.8% of votes) to third place this year (with 18.4%).\nThis despite the fact that Quinta Switzerland traditionally votes more in favour of climate than the rest of the country, as happened in recent popular votes on this issue. According to Martina Mousson, a polytologue of gfs.bern, the decline of Verdi is linked to the current context, both abroad and in Switzerland.\nAt the time of these elections, the situation was basically different from that of four years ago. \"Although the question of climate remains one of the main concerns of Swiss and Swiss, it was clearly not a relevant issue for the elections and was shadowed by other global issues\", such as war in Ukraine, economic situation or inflation, Martina Mousson analyzes. \"Switzerland is not the only country concerned [from this trend ndt]\", observes polytologue.\nAt national level, the Socialist Party (PS) recorded the second largest increase (+1.2 points), behind the Central Democratic Union (UDC), reaching 18% of the votes. Externally, the PS recorded the biggest gains (2.8 points, from 17.6% to 20.4% of the votes).\nThe main change in the diaspora vote in 2023 seems to be the transfer of votes to the Greens in 2019 to the PS.\nDoes this mean that the Greens have lost the confidence of the expat population? \"I don't think the Greens did anything wrong,\" says Martina Mousson. \"In general, right-wing parties have more chances of doing well in uncertain global situations,\" he explains. For politologa, the ecologist parties were probably victims of this year's global economic situation, while they benefited four years ago.\nOn the other hand, in contrast to the national framework, it cannot be said that the UDC has triumphed at the urns between the Swiss and the Swiss expatriates.\nThe right-wing conservative party, the country's first political force, which this year has recorded the largest growth (9 seats and 28.6% of the votes, with an increase of 3 percentage points), has recorded an increase even outside the Swiss borders, although more moderate: from 18% to 18.5% of the votes of the diaspora.\nThe UDC remains the second political force between the electorate abroad, but with scores still significantly lower than those obtained at national level.\nIn Switzerland it is regularly asked whether the UDC can exceed the 30% barrier. \"It always comes close, but it never did,\" says Martina Mousson. It is clear that there is a maximum limit for the UDC, both in the Confederation and abroad. Only time will tell us how far this border is inamovable.\nHowever, the Swiss electorate abroad is traditionally more liberal and left-wing than the rest of the country. \"It's not a novelty, so I'm not surprised that the UDC has not made any more breaches\" in the Fifth Switzerland, the specialist commented.\nOverall, the way the diaspora voted for these legislative elections confirms the tendency of this voter to vote more on the left and greener than the national population. The main left-wing parties (PS and Verdi) obtained almost 39% of the votes (compared to 27% of Switzerland); the combined force of the Green and Green Liberal parties has reached 30% abroad (compared with 17% in Switzerland).\nThe scores of the other parties remain relatively stable. The Centre has earned 0.9 percentage points, approaching the increase of 0.8% obtained at national level. Also for the radical liberal party the trend was more or less the same among voters and espatriate electrics compared to the rest of Switzerland: the right party lost 0.6 points (compared to 0.7 of the entire country).\nAs often happens, diaspora's turnout abroad remained low: altogether it was 18.7%, falling in almost all cantons except Basel City and St. Gall. On the national level, however, it increased slightly compared to 2019, from 45.1% to 46.6%.\nIn federal elections, 43 Swiss and Swiss were candidates abroad. No wonder none of these applications went well. However, the results of two diaspora members have been distinguished.\nThe foreign candidate who obtained the most votes was Pascal Cuttat, Nairobi, in the Canton of Bern. 12\u2019451 Bernishes voted for the 61-year-old socialist, working for the Swiss Red Cross. This good result compared to other applications abroad is explained by the fact that its name was present in the main list of socialist men from Bernese. Cuttat, however, got the worst result of his list.\nIn Geneva, Green Rudolf Berli had a great success. With 11\u2019947 votes, he finished fourth in the Canton\u2019s ecologist list. Pougny (France) has received 4,271 votes in Geneva alone and 999 from abroad.\nThe last election of a national advisor from abroad was Tim Guldimann for the PS in the Canton of Zurich. In 2015 he obtained a brilliant result, winning 102\u2019757 votes. At the time he was not the first Swiss abroad to sit in Parliament, but the first to be elected while living outside the national borders. Guldimann resigned in 2018, claiming that it was difficult to \"live in an environment and make politics in another\".\nIn practice, Swiss and Swiss abroad have little chance of being elected, says Ariane Rustichelli, director of the Swiss Organization abroad (OSE). \"The Guldimann case was exceptional,\" he says.\nThe OSE has a working group supporting direct representation in Parliament. It is a recurring request, but so far it has never been realized, because it would require a change of the Constitution.\nOther developments\nDebate\nHow do you read these results? Is the trend similar in the country where you live? Your opinion interests us.\nOther developments\n\nA milestone in vacilla democracy.

                "en_content": "The right conservative conquered the Swiss electorate once again, aiming at the fight against immigration. Sunday thus obtained its second best result ever (28.6%). This is the most important issue when it comes to choosing a party, immediately after the increase of health insurance premiums and climate change. This is what emerges from the post-electoral analysis conducted by the Sotomo Institute.\nAccording to the survey, the vast majority (74%) of the electorate of the Central Democratic Union (UDC) gave its vote to this party because of its migration policy. The right conservative managed to grab the monopoly on this subject, landing the competition of other parties on the migration issue. The independence and sovereignty of the country, themes also addressed by the UDC, were decisive only for 21% of those who voted for the conservative right.\nGreat defeat of the electoral Sunday, the Green Party failed to arouse the same enthusiasm around climate policy. Although his electorate was almost exclusively mobilized by this theme, other parties also benefited from it. Many people voted for the Socialist Party (PS) also because of its programme to combat climate change. The PS was also more convincing about social issues such as health insurance premiums and social security.\nPost-electoral analysis reveals that with its strategy the UDC has managed to conquer voters and electrics of all parties and to mobilize new ones. On the contrary, the Greens saw a part of their electorate moving towards almost all other parties, except for the radical Liberal Party. More than half of the Green Party's losses went to the PS, but the Greens also lost ground for the UDC, the Centre and the Liberal Green Party.\nThe post-electoral poll on the federal elections of 22 October 2023 was conducted by the Sotomo research institute on behalf of the Swiss Broadcasting Society (SSR, SWI swissinfo.ch). The data was collected between 21 and 23 October. A total of 23,207 voters participated in the survey, both on the SSR Internet portals and on the Sotomo website. The error margin is +/- 1.2 percentage points.\nSotomo's polythologists and polytologues have also analyzed the reasons why some people have changed parties during these federal elections. Almost a third of them was dissatisfied with the way the party voted previously had faced the increase in health insurance premiums. This has especially favored the PS, but also the Center. A quarter of these people did not agree with the migration policy of their party and more than half of them later joined the UDC.\nDiscussions about gender and wokism are the most cited as a reason to choose another party, as well as the polarization of political debates. Most of these people decided to vote for the Center, according to the survey.\nThe new Parliament is now slightly more right and less green. However, the Swiss people seem to count on the new legislation to achieve the energy transition: 46% of the electorate considers it a priority, according to the Sotomo Institute.\n\"This theme is no longer exclusive to the Greens,\" notes Sotomo's polytologue Sarah B\u00fctikofer. The vote on the climate law, approved by the electorate last June, has shown that all parties recognize that Switzerland must take care of its energy supply and implement the necessary changes, adds B\u00fctikofer.\nI Greens were the first to talk about energy transition decades ago, but their position is now shared by most political formations, believes polytologue. \"It is therefore no longer necessary to vote in favour of ecologists if we want someone in Parliament to commit themselves to this issue,\" he says.\nDespite the move to the right of Parliament, social demands have not disappeared. The top priority of the electorate is the portfolio: 66% of voters believe that the new legislation should find solutions to limit the increase in health costs and health insurance premiums (health tax).\nThe people now seem to have more confidence in the right to address these social issues. This is not paradox, according to Sara B\u00fctikofer. The UDC, mentioned, is very present in population groups with lower incomes. \"After the beginning of the right to asylum, this is the second priority of the party,\" he said.\nOther developments\n\nA milestone in vacilla democracy.

For me and for all my colleagues and colleagues it was a radical change of life.\"\nToday, the new publication managed by Timchenko is very popular not only in Russia but also internationally, since it offers news both in Russian and in English. \"Meduza is a multimedia platform that makes her voice heard on all social networks, messenger services and through newsletters,\" adds the journalist. In this way, Timchenko managed to reach many young people, who today represent half of the people who regularly consult the site.\nHowever, in March, as a direct consequence of the Russian attack on Ukraine, meduza.io was blocked in Russia by the authorities. \"Since then, a hundred new laws have been approved in Russia that limit freedom of press. There is a military censorship and the victims are the media: 100 newspapers have been classified as 'foreign agents' and are charged with treason and espionage.

The island is located almost 2'000 kilometers from the capital Tokyo and more than 1'000 miles from Kyushu, one of the four largest islands in the country. About 50,000 people live in Ishigaki, including the 28-year-old Manami Miyara, born and raised there. Despite its remoteness and its size \u2013 about once and a half Liechtenstein \u2013 Ishigaki has recently been at the center of international geopolitical power struggles in East Asia.\nAs a direct neighbour to the Senkaku archipelago, disputed and uninhabited, Ishigaki found himself at the forefront of the struggle for geopolitical influence in the East China Sea. For this reason, the self-defense forces of Japan intend to install a new base on the subtropical island \u2013 a very controversial move that pushed the inhabitants, Manami understood, to make their voice heard.\nHowever, there is an even bigger story to tell about the situation the 28-year-old is living. Ishigaki is part of Okinawa Prefecture, today the southernmost part of Japan. Okinawa, formed by a chain of dozens of islands extending on a line almost 1'000 kilometers long, was an independent kingdom until the end of the 19th century.\nIt later became a buffer zone between Japanese and Chinese interests before being annexed from Tokyo in 1879. During World War II, Okinawa was the only battlefield in Japanese territory. The United States has occupied the archipelago for decades, until 1973, when the Japanese regained control.\nFor the people of Okinawa, the problem of military bases is daily bread: about two-thirds of US military facilities in Japan are still concentrated in Okinawa. As a result, due to its remote geographical situation and the different historical path undertaken, the inhabitants of Okinawa are perhaps more likely to make their voice heard through initiatives and referendums than the compatriots on the major islands, explains Manami in the first video of our series \"Voci di libert\u00e0 dal mondo\".\nOther developments\n\nA milestone in vacilla democracy.

                "en_content": ": So far we have dealt with ten sanctions packages, we have had over 8,000 requests for information via email, more than 10,000 phone calls and various parliamentary initiatives as well as dialogue with the EU, the UK and the United States \u2013 an incredible amount of work. All this has made our resources not enough last year. That is why we have already created five temporary jobs in 2022 and now we will create five more jobs.\nBefore the war in Ukraine, we had 8 people to implement 24 regimes of sanctions. Now we have just over 20. About two thirds work on sanctions against Russia. This is not just legal information and clarification. Even cases where goods are blocked need our intervention. If a company is owned by a person subjected to sanctions, rents and wages must continue to be paid. For all these payments an exemption permit is required by the SECO.\nBe careful not to compare apples and oranges. The SECO has other tasks, equally important, which are carried out by its departments in other countries. Moreover, the number of people is not decisive, it is also a matter of quality. They serve experts and experts in compliance. Other countries, for example the United Kingdom, have difficulty finding enough competent persons.\nOther developments\n\nSwitzerland carries out a dangerous game of balancing with the EU from which it could be defeated.\nWe see her differently. The resources were practically tripled, just like in other countries. The European Commission employs 25 people for sanctions.\nBesides, SECO is not the only one that deals with the implementation of sanctions. We have the support of the State Secretariat for International Financial Issues (SFI), the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAE), the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), the Public Ministry of the Confederation, the Ministry of Migration Status (SEM) and others.\nWe don't think a task force would improve efficiency. It would change the label. The same people would be involved.\nWe must implement measures in both sectors. There are many speculations about the size of patricians in Switzerland. It is important to distinguish between unsanctioned goods and frozen goods. We were almost the first in the world to provide figures. The banks have a blocking obligation: they must freeze the goods and then communicate it to the SECO.\nI would say yes, although of course I cannot guarantee that there are no black sheep. But yes, today Swiss banks are very careful.\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to receive our articles.\nBanks know, but we can't know. It should be stressed that media coverage focuses on people and sanctioned funds. But the regulation provides for other measures, such as prohibitions of technology and services or restrictions on the export of goods, which work well and can be more effective to weaken the military capabilities of Russia that allow it to continue its war in Ukraine.\nTrustees and legal studies are subject to the obligation to report in case of sanctions. The only cases where there is no such reporting obligation are those where there is a suspicion of money laundering, but you are trying to extend the law to these professional groups as well. We are also discussing the introduction of a register of actual company owners. This could help, but it will not be the magic wand.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nMelissa Parke, the new ICAN executive director, talks about the challenges to overcome for a future without nuclear weapons.\nIt's pure fantasy. It was first sanctioned by the EU and then also by Switzerland. And also the wife, first from the EU and later from us. In the United States and the United Kingdom, instead, he is sanctioned and she is not.\nWe are aware of these companies and have requested information. It is important to understand the idea of the price ceiling: It is not a trade ban, but a roof at the price. The aim is to maintain global energy supplies without Russia being able to finance war with the resulting profits.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nWestern sanctions imposed on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine caused a stir in global oil trade.\nThe idea is G7.\nThey have the same obligation to report assets that have banks, for example, but for the rest they do not have reporting obligations. In the EU, this aspect is regulated exactly the same way. There is also a EU recommendation on transaction documentation, not legally binding, to which we refer.\nWe follow the reports of partner states or media, for example. It follows a complex procedure.\nAlso this is a falsehood. We specifically follow the indications from various sources. Other countries also act like this. We proceed on the basis of risk. It doesn't make much sense to want to control all reports or all financial intermediaries. Nobody does.\nWe are in contact with companies, we have customs statistics and reports coming to the Communications Office on money laundering (MROS). People acting as financial intermediaries are obliged to make these reports, even in the case of violations of sanctions that constitute a possible crime for money laundering.\nToday we exchange figures and documents weekly, especially with the EU, but it also works well with the United States. If Switzerland is to be officially part of an international task force, it is more than a political question.\nIt would be a massive violation of fundamental rights. It is hardly conceivable in a rule of law. It is a theme similar to that of the possible confiscation of frozen goods. I do not say that it would be absolutely impossible for Switzerland, but it would require an internationally agreed legal basis and, in individual cases, people affected should have the right to defend themselves legally.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland must change its mindset about transparency, says Tom Keatinge.\nArticles mentioned\nSeries Switzerland and sanctions against Russia\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

Questo \u00e8 ci\u00f2 che il presidente Bach vuole evitare, anche se forse sta lasciando l'impressione di fare marcia indietro.",
                    "L'argomento della necessaria neutralit\u00e0 delle organizzazioni sportive internazionali \u00e8 gi\u00e0 stato sollevato nel corso della storia, ad esempio durante i Giochi di Berlino. Nell'agosto 1936, mentre la Germania si preparava alla guerra, Hitler dichiar\u00f2: \"La competizione sportiva e cavalleresca risveglia le migliori qualit\u00e0 umane. Non separa, ma unisce gli avversari nella comprensione e nel rispetto reciproci. Contribuisce inoltre a rafforzare i legami di pace tra le nazioni. Che la fiamma olimpica non si spenga mai\".",
                    "L'allora presidente del CIO, il conte belga Henri de Baillet-Latour, concluse: \"Berlino \u00e8 stata il luogo di incontro di tutti i popoli, e da essa \u00e8 emersa un'unit\u00e0 senza la quale non si potrebbero mai raggiungere n\u00e9 la pace, n\u00e9 la felicit\u00e0\". Rifiutandosi di revocare l'organizzazione dei Giochi al Terzo Reich, come chiedevano all'epoca milioni di persone che lottavano per la pace e la democrazia su entrambe le sponde dell'Atlantico, il CIO serv\u00ec la causa di Hitler. \u00c8 una macchia indelebile sulla sua storia, che finora non ha voluto affrontare.",

Grazie al reclutamento per cooptazione, che non \u00e8 certo democratico, il CIO potrebbe benissimo eleggere i suoi membri tra i leader sportivi che si battono per le libert\u00e0, invece di permettere ai regimi autoritari di imporre le loro scelte.",

                "en_content": "The tension is rising between the CIO and Russia. After the invasion of Ukraine, the chairman of the committee Thomas Bach had initially recommended to exclude completely Russian athletes and athletes from sports competitions, and then back off, proposing instead their participation under neutral flag.\nRussia, for its part, threatens to launch similar sports competitions with China, Brazil, India or South Africa, while Ukraine announced its refusal to participate in the Olympic Games in Paris in 2024 if Russian athletes and athletes will be present.\nBach fears that international sport is divided into two political blocks. He recently stated that \"the universal Olympic Games would no longer be possible\".\nA year after the next Olympics, what should the CIO do to avoid taking a road without exit? Does its principle of neutrality prevail over the interests of Ukrainian sports and sportsmen? In an interview with SWI swissinfo.ch, Patrick Clastres, historian of Olympicism at the University of Lausanne, talks about the CIO hesitation and the risks of a schism of international sport.\n: This is the third time Vladimir Putin has been drinking the Olympic Truce: the destabilization and dismemberment of Georgia took place during the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008, the annexation of Crimea during the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014 and the military invasion of Ukraine, on 24 February 2022, just four days after the end of the Winter Olympic Games in Beijing.\nCertainly international condemnation in this last case was much more intense. In addition, Putin's project to rebuild the former Russian Empire has become so clear that it poses a threat to the Baltic States, Poland, Moldova and Finland.\nOther developments\n\nSwitzerland carries out a dangerous game of balancing with the EU from which it could be defeated.\nThomas Bach must also deal with the pressures that numerous athletes and athletes and Olympic leaders from Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, Norway and Sweden exercise through social media. Those who are in Switzerland, France and in the peninsular states of Europe have a low profile: is it due to respect for sports neutrality, or should it be considered a sign of bad health of democracy?\n\"The CIO is under pressure from international sports sponsors, who do not want to risk being associated with war. \"\nReturning to the CIO, it also undergoes the pressure, little visible but decisive, of the sponsors of international sport, who do not want to risk being associated with war. The decision of 2022 allowed the CIO to benefit, in a second time, of the loss of Russian influence within many international sports federations. We do not forget that Bach was taken for the nose by the institutionalized doping system introduced in Russia between 2011 and 2015 and the consequent destruction of evidence and information.\nFour days after the invasion of Ukraine, Bach asked the federations to exclude athletes and athletes from Russia and Belarus from competitions, to put an end to international competitions within these two countries and to suspend their sports leaders from every international mandate. He did so in the name of the Olympic Truce, proclaimed by the UN General Assembly, which begins two weeks before the Games and ends two weeks after their end. The sports federations immediately aligned - except those of shooting, boxing, sambo and judo, whose leaders are close to Putin.\nAnnouncing last January of wanting to \"try a way\" to reintegrate Russian and Belarusian athletes and athletes in international sports competitions, Bach surprised some people. In fact, it was the answer to an urgency: allow athletes and athletes of these two countries to participate in the qualifying for the Paris Olympics, in case the war ended before summer 2024.\nTime holds for the CIO, if you want to remain the incarnation of Olympic universalism. In the face of the reticence of various national Olympic Committees (CON) European, it has made it known that the Asian Association of CON has been prepared to welcome athletes and athletes of Russia and Belarus in their competitions to allow their possible qualification.\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to receive our articles.\nCompared with the reactions indignant to the declaration of 25 January, at least in the West, Bach wanted to clarify the position of the IOC without jeopardizing a future decision on the Paris Olympics. By extending financial aid to the Ukrainian CON, he asked the federations to verify that people with Russian or Belarusian passport participated in the races only individually (so not in team sports, which would incarnate the nation), and under neutral flag (no banner, coat of arms, anthem, no presence in medals and carrying only white or monochromatic clothing).\nHe added three conditions: that athletes and athletes fulfilled all the rules of the World Anti-Doping Code, which did not actively support the war in Ukraine and that they were not under contract with the army or security services. This has demonstrated the ability of the IOC to imagine completely unpublished diplomatic solutions.\nAlthough the last two conditions have been judged discriminatory by one of the two experts of the United Nations requested by the IOC, they are proportional to the ultimate purpose: do not deprive the Olympic Games of athletes and athletes who have no responsibility in the war.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nMelissa Parke, the new ICAN executive director, talks about the challenges to overcome for a future without nuclear weapons.\nThe result was a cacophony of reactions: the majority of the federations followed the indications of the IOC, with differences in the reactions that betrayed a certain Russian influence, while others (atletics, badminton, riding, climbing, surfing) rejected them.\nIt is not sure that many athletes and athletes from Russia and Belarus will qualify for Paris 2024. In order to avoid the detachment of a reduced Olympic delegation to the bone, Putin may decide not to send an athlete. The CIO would thus maintain neutrality, while avoiding a boycott of the Games by Ukraine and its allies.\nThe Ukrainian government plays its role using this threat as a tool for sports \u201csoft power\u201d. The response of the IOC seems to be an agitated embrace that betrays the discomfort in the face of this diplomatic dilemma.\nIs it possible to imagine, for Paris 2024, the absence of Ukraine and the presence of Russia and Belarus, even if under neutral flag? The CIO's response is to say that Olympic universalism would no longer make sense if the 70 countries currently living a war situation were excluded from the Games, or if the Olympics were to be limited to the democracies alone, which are, in fact, minority in the world.\nIn fact, the vast majority of current conflicts are civil wars and latent border. A war of annexation such as Russia is a unique case, especially in Europe, which has already been the epicenter of two world wars.\n\"Olympic universalism would make no sense if it were to be limited [...] to the only democracies that are, in fact, a minority in the world. \"\nAlthough democracies are a minority in the world, this does not justify the failure to denounce human rights violations, whose universalism is denied by regimes supporting Russia. Everything depends on which side the CIO wants to be.\nSome voices criticize how those who ask for sanctions use two weights and two measures. For example, the exclusion of the United Kingdom and the United States from the Olympic Games at the time of the war in Iraq, which was conducted in a manner not in conformity with international law. In this way it is neglected that many people and a part of Western politics had opposed that war.\nTo avoid two weights and two measures, it is up to the IOC to adopt clear rules, expressing itself in favour of the exclusion from the Olympic Games of any country that conducts a war of annexation and inserting in its statute binding rules for the participation of athletes and athletes of the countries in question. The CIO can thus fully rediscover its founding mission of promoting international peace through sport.\nThe reverse of course of the CIO is explained with its ancient fear of seeing rise international competition organizations.\n\"The reversal of the IOC is explained with its ancient fear of seeing rise international competition organizations. \"\nIt is true that Russia is using its sports diplomacy to hire this type of iron arm. In June 2022, Russian Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin, former president of the International Federation of University Sports, traveled to India to extend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) to the sports industry. Established in 2001 for economic and strategic purposes from China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, this organization can be seen as a counterpart to the OECD and NATO.\nIndia and Pakistan joined it and Iran, Belarus, Afghanistan and Mongolia will soon be added. Matytsin also established links with South Africa, Brazil, Bosnia, Mali, Peru and some Gulf States, to the point of suggesting that SCO is extending to the global South for sport.\nPutin and Matytsin recently invited SCO sports ministers to send their athletic delegations to the Ekaterinburg University Sports Festival in August 2023, to the Friendship Games scheduled in Kazan immediately after the Paris Olympics, and to the next Russian-Islamic World Forum. In 2024, the world of sport could therefore be divided into two, with the Olympic Games of liberal democracies on one side and the \"Amicizia Games\" of authoritarian regimes on the other. This is what President Bach wants to avoid, although perhaps he is leaving the impression of turning back.\nThe subject of the necessary neutrality of international sports organizations has already been raised in history, for example during the Berlin Games. In August 1936, while Germany was preparing for war, Hitler declared: \"The sport and cavalry competition awakens the best human qualities. It does not separate, but unites opponents in mutual understanding and respect. It also contributes to strengthening the bonds of peace between nations. May the Olympic flame never turn out.\"\nThe then President of the CIO, the Belgian Count Henri de Baillet-Latour, concluded: \"Berlin was the meeting place of all peoples, and a unity emerged from it without which one could never reach peace or happiness.\" Refused to revoke the organization of the Games to the Third Reich, as millions of people at the time demanded for peace and democracy on both sides of the Atlantic, the CIO served Hitler's cause. It is an indelible stain on its history, which so far did not want to face.\n\"Refusing to revoke the organization of the 1936 Games from the Third Reich [...], the CIO served Hitler's cause.\"\nStaying out of political discourse means allowing Olympic universalism to become the Trojan horse of those who oppose peace and human rights. Armed with this lesson in history, the IOC must learn to choose to place itself on the side of peace, which is indissolubly linked to freedom and human rights.\nIn a way, his fortune lies in the fact that he is not modeled on the United Nations, with a General Assembly in which each country has a vote and a Security Council that can block initiatives through veto law. Thanks to the recruitment for co-option, which is not democratic, the CIO could well elect its members among the sports leaders who fight for freedom, instead of allowing authoritarian regimes to impose their choices.\nIt would thus become a fully autonomous institution, acting as a democratic and peaceful guard dog for the sports world, avoiding athletes and athletes to take political risks. Only on this condition could the CIO one day be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

                    " dimostra che negli ultimi anni le raffinerie d'oro elvetiche hanno lavorato grandi quantit\u00e0 di oro di origine russa proveniente da Londra.\u00a0",
                    "Dal 2021, 110 tonnellate del metallo prezioso, per un valore di oltre sei miliardi di franchi, sono passate attraverso\u00a0fonderie situate nella Confederazione. Solo dall'inizio della guerra, nel febbraio 2022, sono giunte in Svizzera 75 tonnellate, secondo i dati dell'Ufficio federale della dogana e della sicurezza dei confini (UDSC).",
                    "Le statistiche mostrano un forte aumento delle importazioni di oro di origine russa in Svizzera. Prima della guerra, ogni anno la Confederazione ne importava in media solo circa 20 tonnellate. A titolo di paragone, solo nei primi cinque mesi di quest'anno, ne sono invece giunte 38 tonnellate, passando\u00a0da Londra.\u00a0",
                    "Il percorso dell'oro russo passa dal Regno Unito. Fino al 2018, il Paese vi esportava pochissimo oro. Poi, le quantit\u00e0 sono esplose: dal 2019 fino allo scoppio della guerra, la Russia ne ha venduto a Londra oltre 700 tonnellate, per un valore di oltre 34 miliardi di franchi, secondo le statistiche ufficiali britanniche\u00a0per il commercio estero.",
                    "L'esperto svizzero di metalli preziosi Bernhard Schnellmann spiega cos\u00ec l'aumento: \"La banca centrale russa ha smesso di acquistare oro a met\u00e0 2019 e poi ha soppresso l'IVA sull'oro\". Di conseguenza le esportazioni aurifere sono fortemente aumentate.\u00a0",
                    "L'ex professore di diritto penale ed esperto di commercio dell'oro Mark Pieth ha una spiegazione diversa. L'esperto ci vede un chiaro collegamento con l'invasione russa dell'Ucraina: \"Presumo che queste vendite servissero a preparare la guerra\", afferma.\u00a0",
                    "Per Pieth, quindi, c'\u00e8 il sospetto che la Russia possa aver riempito il suo forziere di guerra con massicce esportazioni di oro. Oltre alle entrate derivanti dalle vendite di gas e petrolio, l'oro potrebbe cos\u00ec aver contribuito a finanziare la guerra di aggressione all'Ucraina.\u00a0",
                    "Il fatto che questo oro sia stato presumibilmente lavorato anche in Svizzera \u00e8 problematico, secondo Pieth, anche se in questo momento il regime russo non starebbe traendo profitti dalle transazioni. \"Se ora le raffinerie svizzere importassero quest'oro e lo rifondessero, non sarebbe problematico dal profilo legale. Sarebbe per\u00f2 eticamente molto discutibile\", afferma Pieth.\u00a0",
                    "Anche Marc Ummel, esperto di materie prime presso l'ong Swissaid, sottolinea questo aspetto. Perch\u00e9 con la rifusione, \"l'oro russo eticamente discutibile\" diventa oro con il marchio di qualit\u00e0 svizzero. \"Si perde la tracciabilit\u00e0, il che \u00e8 molto problematico\", afferma.\u00a0",
                    "Le raffinerie d'oro in Svizzera non vedono alcun collegamento tra la lavorazione dell'oro di origine russa e le attivit\u00e0 belliche del Cremlino. Da noi contattato, Christoph Wild, presidente dell'Associazione svizzera dei fabbricanti e dei commercianti di metalli preziosi afferma che \"quest'oro non \u00e8 sottoposto a sanzioni e non ha nulla a che fare con l'etica. \u00c8 stato prodotto prima dell'inizio della guerra\".\u00a0",
                    "Finch\u00e9 si pu\u00f2 dimostrare che si tratta di oro esportato dalla Russia al Regno Unito prima della guerra e quindi dell'inizio delle sanzioni, Wild non vede alcun problema etico nella sua lavorazione. \"Non si tratta di una sparizione forzata dell'oro russo\", dice.\u00a0",
                    "In Svizzera vige il divieto di \"acquistare, importare o trasportare\" oro dalla Russia. Lo ha deciso il Consiglio federale nell'agosto del 2022.\u00a0",

                "en_content": "Has the Swiss gold industry played a role in financing Putin's war of aggression against Ukraine? A joint research of the Rundschau broadcast of the German-speaking Swiss Television SRF and the weekly\nshows that in recent years the Swiss gold refineries have worked large amounts of Russian gold from London.\nSince 2021, 110 tons of precious metal, worth more than six billion francs, have passed through foundries located in the Confederation. Only from the beginning of the war, in February 2022, 75 tons arrived in Switzerland, according to the data of the Federal Office of Customs and Security of the borders (UDSC).\nStatistics show a strong increase in Russian gold imports in Switzerland. Before the war, every year the Confederation imported only about 20 tonnes on average. As a comparison, only in the first five months of this year, there were 38 tonnes, passing from London.\nThe path of Russian gold passes from the UK. Until 2018, the country exported very little gold. Then, the quantities have exploded: from 2019 until the outbreak of the war, Russia has sold more than 700 tons to London, worth more than 34 billion francs, according to British official statistics for foreign trade.\nThe Swiss expert on precious metals Bernhard Schnellmann explains the increase: \"The Russian central bank stopped buying gold in mid-2019 and then suppressed the gold VAT.\" As a result, aurifer exports are strongly increased.\nThe former professor of criminal law and gold trade expert Mark Pieth has a different explanation. The expert sees us a clear connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine: \"I assume these sales served to prepare the war,\" he says.\nFor Pieth, therefore, there is suspicion that Russia may have filled its war chest with massive gold exports. In addition to revenue from gas and oil sales, gold could thus have helped finance the war of aggression against Ukraine.\nThe fact that this gold was supposedly worked in Switzerland is problematic, according to Pieth, although at this time the Russian regime would not be profiting from transactions. \"If now the Swiss refineries imported this gold and renamed it, it would not be legally problematic. But it would be ethically very questionable,\" says Pieth.\nMarc Ummel, an expert in raw materials at the old Swissaid, also underlines this aspect. Because with recasting, \"Russian gold and ethically questionable\" becomes gold with the Swiss quality brand. \"You lose traceability, which is very problematic,\" he says.\nGold refineries in Switzerland do not see any connection between the processing of gold of Russian origin and the war activities of the Kremlin. We contacted him, Christoph Wild, president of the Swiss Association of Manufacturers and traders of precious metals, states that \"this gold is not subject to sanctions and has nothing to do with ethics. It was produced before the beginning of the war.\"\nAs long as it can be shown that it is gold exported from Russia to the United Kingdom before the war and therefore the beginning of sanctions, Wild does not see any ethical problem in its processing. \"This is not a forced disappearance of Russian gold,\" he says.\nIn Switzerland there is a ban on \"purchase, import or transport\" gold from Russia. The Federal Council decided in August 2022.\nAs for the gold of Russian origin imported in Switzerland in recent years, UDSC states that \"it's all legal\" and that imports have been controlled. Gold originally came from Russia, but had already been exported to the United Kingdom before the war began in Ukraine in February 2022. It does not come directly from Russia and does not serve to directly finance the war.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nTicino is an important centre of trade in steel products from Eastern Europe. War and sanctions are putting him in trouble.\nOther developments\n\nSwitzerland carries out a dangerous game of balancing with the EU from which it could be defeated.\nArticles mentioned\nSeries Switzerland and sanctions against Russia\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

O meglio, non siede al tavolo di Bruxelles, ma costituzionalmente ha deciso che attuer\u00e0 qualsiasi decisione presa a Bruxelles in materia di sanzioni. Questo porta inevitabilmente a una discrepanza, poich\u00e9 potrebbe finire per dover attuare misure con cui non \u00e8 d'accordo.",

Come pu\u00f2 un Paese garantire che non ci sia un legame tra una persona sanzionata e una societ\u00e0 che opera nella sua giurisdizione se non dispone di tutte le informazioni? I media scopriranno velocemente che un legame c'\u00e8. Questo \u00e8 un servizio prezioso che l'industria mediatica ha svolto per diversi anni.",

Senza un registro decente, non si potr\u00e0 convincere la gente della propria innocenza.

                    "Tuttavia, \u00e8 importante ricordare che lo standard del GAFI \u00e8 uno standard minimo. Un Paese che si accontenta di soddisfare gli standard minimi suscita il sospetto di essere un Paese che facilita l'aggiramento delle sanzioni.",

Impegnandosi attivamente nel regime delle sanzioni, dimostrando che sta congelando i beni e sfruttando le competenze nazionali (ad esempio nel commercio di materie prime e nel private banking) per fare pressione sull'economia russa, contribuir\u00e0 ad allontanare i sospetti che ancora circondano la sua integrit\u00e0 finanziaria.",
                    "Le sanzioni sono concordate a Bruxelles, ma questa \u00e8 solo la cornice. Ogni Paese ha la propria legge di attuazione. Il risultato \u00e8 che ci sono definizioni diverse per termini come propriet\u00e0 e controllo. La maggior Parte degli Stati dice che se una persona sanzionata possiede una quota superiore al 50% di una determinata entit\u00e0, questa deve essere soggetta a sanzioni, ma l'interpretazione del controllo (quando una persona controlla ma non possiede una compagnia) differisce tra un Paese e l'altro. Questa mancanza di armonizzazione provoca falle che possono essere sfruttate.",
                    "\u00c8 anche importante dire che le banche sono da tempo sensibili al tema dell'attuazione delle sanzioni, perch\u00e9 esse stesse hanno avuto guai con la giustizia statunitense, ma le imprese europee hanno pochissima esperienza nell'implementazione delle sanzioni. Le compagnie attive nel commercio di materie prime hanno dovuto pensarci un po' in passato, ma non ai livelli attuali con la Russia.",

Quali sono i passi da compiere per realizzare questo cambiamento? La risposta pi\u00f9 semplice potrebbe essere che tutti gli scambi commerciali con la Russia o con i Paesi intermediari che vendono alla Russia dovrebbero essere azzerati. E poi si discute della possibilit\u00e0 di concedere alcune esenzioni, ad esempio per i farmaci.",
                    "La mia idea \u00e8 che gli alleati dell'Ucraina debbano agire per impedire al Cremlino di finanziare e rifornire le proprie forze armate.

                    "Ma sappiamo anche che la Russia sta passando da un'economia civile a un'economia militare e di guerra. Le fabbriche che producevano autobus ora producono carri armati. Dobbiamo quindi riflettere su quanto ampio debba essere l'embargo. Occorre quindi affrontare la questione della vendita a Paesi terzi attraverso i quali i prodotti potrebbero arrivare in Russia, cosa che sta chiaramente accadendo.",
                    "Ci sono aziende in Svizzera, Regno Unito, Germania e Francia che hanno visto aumentare le vendite a Paesi terzi non allineati dall'anno scorso. Queste aziende dovrebbero chiedersi perch\u00e9 queste vendite sono aumentate e se possono essere collegate all'elusione delle sanzioni russe - \u00e8 ingenuo pensare che non lo siano.",

                "en_content": ": Switzerland is in an interesting position. It is a legal order that will remain guilty in the eyes of the world at least for another generation. So, I think I have to do everything and more to convince people who are on the good side and prove their innocence.\nThe Confederation has been subjected to pressure by the G7, but is also in a difficult position because, to some extent, it has decision-making power in Brussels. I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he is a member of the Committee on Budgets. This inevitably leads to a discrepancy, as it may end up having to implement measures with which it does not agree.\nWithout a register on transparent companies, the ability to implement sanctions is significantly reduced. How can a country ensure that there is no link between a sanctioned person and a company operating in its jurisdiction if it does not have all the information? The media will quickly find a connection. This is a valuable service that the media industry has done for several years.\nI think that a good register of companies - to quote a colleague in Latvia - is the \"saving platform to rely on if you want to be sure of the implementation of sanctions\". Without a decent register, people of their innocence cannot be persuaded. We can discuss whether the register should be public or not, but if the authorities do not have access to certain information, then they cannot do their best to implement sanctions.\nSwitzerland was submitted to the anti-money laundering evaluation by the International Financial Action Group (GAFI) long ago, before the Panama Papers. Since 2016, GAFI has introduced higher standards. So, a country that has been assessed last year must meet higher demands than what Switzerland has done.\nThe Confederation will have to face a great test when it is again assessed in the coming years. What will you do from here to then to make sure you have increased your standards in line with the expectations of GAFI? He can't say: \"We did good ten years ago.\" I think Switzerland has to look forward, not back.\nHowever, it is important to remember that the GAFI standard is a minimum standard. A country that is content to meet the minimum standards arouses the suspicion of being a country that facilitates the adjustment of sanctions.\nOther developments\n\nLike many other developed countries, Switzerland is confronted with an important shortage of personnel in many sectors.\nFrankly, you must be. As already mentioned, Switzerland is paying - wrongly or rightly - a certain reputation of secrecy and opacity. Employing actively in the regime of sanctions, demonstrating that it is freezing goods and exploiting national skills (e.g. in commodity trade and private banking) to press the Russian economy, will help to remove the suspicions that still surround its financial integrity.\nThe sanctions are agreed in Brussels, but this is only the framework. Each country has its own law of implementation. The result is that there are different definitions for terms such as ownership and control. Most states say that if a sanctioned person has a share of more than 50% of a certain entity, this must be subject to sanctions, but the interpretation of control (when a person controls but does not own a company) differs between one country and another. This lack of harmonization causes fouls that can be exploited.\nIt is also important to say that banks have long been sensitive to the issue of the implementation of sanctions, because they themselves have had trouble with US justice, but European companies have very little experience in implementing sanctions. Companies active in commodity trade had to think about it a bit in the past, but not at current levels with Russia.\nSpeaking with lawyers and consultants, they will tell you that they still have customers who are trying to continue the business where they are not subject to sanctions. There are those who say that companies must do \"the right thing\", regardless of whether sanctions are in force or not. But what does it mean in the business world to do the right thing?\nI have some understanding for companies that say: \"You may not like what we are doing from an ethical point of view or reputation, but we are operating in compliance with the law. Our lawyers approved what we're doing. If the law changes, we will change our way of acting.\"\nWhat I like to ask politicians and policies is: what should be changed in the implementation of sanctions against Russia? What are the steps to make this change? The simplest answer could be that all trade with Russia or with the intermediary countries that sell to Russia should be reset. And then we discuss the possibility of granting some exemptions, for example for drugs.\nMy idea is that the allies of Ukraine must act to prevent the Kremlin from financing and supplying its armed forces. If this is our goal, we must ensure that sanctions on products such as high-tech electronics are as unattachable as possible.\nBut we also know that Russia is moving from a civil economy to a military and war economy. The factories producing buses now produce tanks. We must therefore consider how much the embargo should be. It is therefore necessary to address the question of sale to third countries through which products could arrive in Russia, which is clearly happening.\nThere are companies in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Germany and France who have seen increased sales to non-aligned third countries since last year. These companies should wonder why these sales have increased and if they can be linked to the elusion of Russian sanctions - it is naive to think that they are not.\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to receive our articles.\nWe must ensure that the private sector is smarter and reflects what it is doing, rather than merely observing the rules.\nNot adhering, it further damages its reputation. Why should Switzerland not join? Some people think the country has something to hide.\nIf I were Switzerland at this time, I would find an area where the country is well known and I would try to understand how to show global leadership in the implementation of sanctions against Russia in that field.\nIf it were the raw material trade sector, I would do four to collaborate with companies like Glencore and Trafigura to help them understand the sanctions and consult them on what changes they would feel useful to achieve change.\nI would do a virtue. I would organize a conference on the implementation of sanctions against Russia in the field of commodity trade, sponsored by Glencore and Trafigura, and invite allied partners to brainstorm on how to develop this particular element of the sanction network.\nI hope so, but it is clear that the main allies think otherwise. Switzerland should take seriously the concerns raised by G7 members. For many, Switzerland will remain guilty until it proves categorically innocent.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe arrival of new pests and the gradual withdrawal of the most toxic products force Europe to temporarily authorize prohibited products.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nAre criticisms of Switzerland for the implementation of sanctions against Russia justified?

The seven-storey building, which houses a fifteen-story Solway employees on the sixth floor, is typical of Zugo. There is a Solway administrative office, which enjoys interesting tax rates, discretion and economic stability for which Switzerland is known.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nBern has always been reluctant to pass laws to force companies to unveil the real owners. The sanctions against Russia will perhaps be a turning point.\nHere it is easy not to be noticed, and this is convenient to Denis Gerasev. One of the only two members of the board of directors of the group, Gerasev, who also manages the legal office, has never released an interview with the media in his 15 years of work in the company.\nWith a dark sweater and casual pants, Gerasev offers some personal details: the paintings leaning on the wall of his office overlooking Lake Zugo were made by his wife and 7-year-old daughter, who live with him in Ober\u00e4geri, a picturesque town on the lake; once he was a motorcycle fan, but he gave up when he became a father.\nFaced with a press officer, Gerasev prepared himself for the interview with copious notes, which is not surprising given what he and the company face. In November 2022, the US Treasury Department\nSolway as a Russian company and sanctioned two employees and two subsidiaries under Magnitsky law, following charges of corruption and Russian influence in the Guatemalan mining industry.\nThe U.S. Treasury did not explain why it defined Solway a Russian company and did not respond to requests for further information from SWI swissinfo.ch.\nSolway, founded two decades ago, is facing an uphill road to defend itself against the accusations of the US Treasury, partly because of its tradition of secrecy, despite its global presence ranging from Indonesia to Ukraine and Guatemala.\nLast November, the Office for Foreign Asset Control at the US Treasury Department (OFAC) sanctioned two Solway employees and two subsidiaries in Guatemala under the Magnitsky Law, which affects citizens and foreign citizens responsible for human rights abuses and corruption. The U.S. Treasury accused the two employees \u2013 a Russian citizen and a Belarusian \u2013 of orchestrating for several years multiple corruption schemes involving politicians, judges and government officials.\nIn his\n, the OFAC has defined Solway Investment Group \"a Russian company that has exploited the mines of Guatemala since 2011\" and said that an employee \"has conducted acts of corruption to promote Russian influence schemes, illegally escalating cash payments to public officials in exchange for support of Russian mining interests\".\nThis took place about eight months after an important media investigation, which involved 65 journalists and journalists and was based on a massive data leak, said that the Guatemalan subsidiaries of the company had tried to silence the leaders of indigenous communities, who had denounced the alleged environmental damage caused by mining projects. The survey raised other reports of suspicious financial transactions between companies connected with Solway and its managers. The company rejected the charges, stating that they were devoid of concrete foundations, and opened an investigation to make clarity.\nOn the website of the company, on Wikipedia and in the registers of the enterprises of Cyprus, Malta and Switzerland there are fragments of information, but there is no clear story about the origins of the company and who has the final control. The group drew the attention of the U.S. authorities following a series of news spread by the media, including a massive survey published by broadcasters such as the\nin March 2022. According to this inquiry, the Guatemalan subsidiaries of the company would have hidden pollution reports and tried to force silence leaders of local communities.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe Solway Investment Group has suspended the activities of two nickel extraction subsidiaries in Guatemala due to US sanctions.\nSolway's involvement in highly sought after minerals and metals, such as nickel used in electric car batteries, makes it increasingly difficult to stay in the shade.\nA recent\nsuggested that the US government is trying to exploit Treasury sanctions to ensure access to Solway's mining activities in Guatemala, in the context of an intense competition with China for strategic resources.\n\"We have never tried to hide anything,\" says Gerasev, stating the group's secrecy statements, despite the lack of information on his website and his reticence to confront the media. The website does not refer to Gerasev and does not present a history of company history. It only indicates that Solway has 5,000 employees, but there are no photos of executives or managers.\nAs a private company, Solway has no obligation to provide any details. There are no shareholders or shareholders who ask for transparency, nor authorities who are obliged to publish the methods of selection of members of the Board of Directors or compensation.\n\"Solway is a family business and has always been,\" says Gerasev at SWI swissinfo.ch. \"It was founded in 2002 by Aleksander Bronstein, a Estonian businessman. The aim of the company was to invest in metals and mines worldwide. \"\nLike many companies in Switzerland, Solway has used a complex corporate structure that makes it difficult to verify its origins or actual properties \u2013 those who ultimately have the income or property rights of the company, or the ability to control its activities. The company was established in Cyprus, known to offer foreign investment a high degree of anonymity.\nIn 2015 Solway moved to Switzerland, Gerasev explains, because it is a well-known center for mining and raw materials. The interesting tax rate and the stability of legislation were also decisive factors.\nThe media survey found hundreds of transactions between 23 companies linked to Solway or its management between 2007 and 2015. Gerasev does not confirm the number of companies, but says that \"there is nothing unusual about this. Companies often use so-called special vehicles for various investments. It is normal that there is more than one society in a group.\"\nThe cantonal register of Zugo is named after Gerasev and the son of Bronstein, Dan Bronstein, who, according to Gerasev, is the managing director of the company. In the register there are three other Solway entities, two of which, according to the company, are branches.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nWestern sanctions imposed on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine caused a stir in global oil trade.\nGerasev confirms that the main shareholder of Solway Investment Group is Solway Holding Malta, information also available on the company's website and in the Zugo cantonal register. In the Malta Business Register, three persons with executive roles and four shareholders, who are companies registered at one address in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\"The inclusion of these entities in the corporate scheme had the sole purpose of harmonizing corporate governance,\" says SWI swissinfo.ch, a press officer of Solway in an email. \"These entities will soon be excluded from the property as a result of the effort to simplify the business structure.\" The Press Officer then confirms that there are 43 direct and indirect subsidiaries of the holding company registered in Malta.\nThe final owners \u2013 according to Gerasev are the sons of Aleksander Bronstein, both German citizens \u2013 are not mentioned either in the register of Malta's enterprises or in the register of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The Malta Register office rejected SWI swissinfo.ch's request for documentation, stating that the \"actual property register is limited to the competent authorities and persons involved as defined in the regulations on the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing\".\nA little more than a week before the publication of this article, Solway's legal team shared with SWI swissinfo.ch an extract from the Malta register, from which it turns out that children, Christian and Dan Bronstein, are the actual owners with 60% and 40% of the shares, respectively. The company did not grant SWI swissinfo.ch permission to publish the document in the light of an EU court ruling limiting public access. A company's press officer states that he considers \"potentially dangerous the publication of a document containing personal data of shareholders, both for those who own companies and their families, and for the company itself\"\nQuestions about Solway's ties with Russia go beyond property. Gerasev is a Russian citizen who obtained Israeli citizenship in 2014. Before moving to Switzerland in 2015, Gerasev lived in Moscow but \" grew up in several countries, including the Soviet Union, the United States and France\".\nAn archive of the company's website on the Internet shows that Solway, which was previously called the Solway Investment Fund, had a representative office in Moscow and expressed pride in his expertise on the Russian economy. Alexander Bronstein was a citizen of the Soviet Union before becoming Estonian, but he never had a Russian passport. From 2003 to 2007\nof the Siberian-Urals Aluminum Company, founded by the Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, who eventually merged with two other aluminum companies.\nMany and many Solway employees are of Russian nationality, but an even greater number comes from Ukraine, according to Gerasev. Russian is also the \"de facto frank language of the company\" because many people working there come from the former Soviet republics.\n\"Having some Russian managers and some people who speak Russian does not mean that the company is Russian, nor is it somehow linked to oligarchs, Kremlin or regime. That's not the same,\" Gerasev says.\nHe insists that the company is not affiliated with the Russian state. This impression was created by the media in 2014 and maintained.\n\"We have a very important branch in Ukraine, called Pobuzhsky\", says Gerasev, referring to an iron-nickel manufacturer. \"When Crimea was annexed by Russia, there was an attempt by some businessmen to take control of our Ukrainian assets and this was done with a defamatory campaign that called Solway a Russian company, because since 2014 Russian companies were not welcome in Ukraine.\" SWI swissinfo.ch has managed to find some reports of media that speak of an attack on the Ukrainian branch.\nOther developments\n\nLike many other developed countries, Switzerland is confronted with an important shortage of personnel in many sectors.\nSolway\nall its projects in Russia, in particular the gold mining operations \u201cKurilgeo\u201d and \u201cZGRK\u201d, in March 2022, shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, because they were \u201cincompatible with the strategy of the group\u201d, says Gerasev. Solway was also publicly expressed against the war in Ukraine and was forced to\nafter a Russian missile attack destroyed a nearby power station.\nSix days after the interview with SWI swissinfo.ch, the company released\nwith the first results of an announced \"independent investigation\" on U.S. charges that led to the sanctions of its Guatemalan subsidiaries, stating that \"though there are connections between Solway, its founder, and commercial entities and Russian individuals, there is no evidence that Solway, its founder or people holding actions have historically, or are currently, controlled or influenced by Russian entities and/or individuals in any way\".\nThe combination of sanctions against Solway's subsidiaries, the war in Ukraine and the multiple media investigations are weighing on the company.\n\"We are operating in a crisis mode,\" Gerasev said. \"It is very important for us to remove the branches from the sanctions list as soon as possible.\"\nIn addition to the financial impact of the blocking of production both in Guatemala and Ukraine, the company is also facing greater control by customers and partners. Last July, Solway and the Salzburg Festival interrupted a sponsorship partnership after the company was unable to fully dissipate human rights abuse charges in Guatemala. The company continues to reiterate that such charges were based on false or imprecise information.\nSolway is slowly improving its transparency, although selectively. Since March 2022, he has published several press releases on his environmental, social and governance commitments, including a human rights policy. Gerasev also stated that an update of the company\u2019s administrative structure is planned to include a wider board of directors.\nThe world is changing, as well as expectations on our sector, says Gerasev. \"We didn't think we weren't transparent, but yes, we will improve.\"\nArticles mentioned\nSeries Switzerland and sanctions against Russia\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

                "en_content": "A letter of early April subjugated Switzerland. In their message, ambassadors from the G7 countries in Bern accused the Federal Council of not doing enough to implement sanctions against the Russian oligarchy.\nIt is interesting to note that the letter does not mention banks, but focuses on lawyers and lawyers, as well as on the very wide provisions of the country regarding data protection.\nIt's no coincidence. While banks have adopted a decisive strategy called \"white money\", which provides for the automatic exchange of information, for some years Swiss law firms have been the subject of recurring criticism, both in Switzerland and abroad. And that for good reasons.\nIt is not the first time since the beginning of the war in Ukraine that Switzerland is subject to such criticism of part of its Western partners. Neutrality is increasingly perceived as a political and economic opportunism: on the one hand because Switzerland has banned Western countries from reexporting the Swiss war material in Ukraine, on the other because too many Russian goods have continued to circulate freely in the Swiss financial centre.\nThe G7 has repeatedly invited Switzerland to participate in its REPO task force (Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs), which aims to track and seize hidden Russian assets. So far, the Federal Council has not seen the need.\nThe data will vary. The Swiss Bankers Association estimated it in a figure of CHF 150 to CHF 200 billion. So far, Switzerland has frozen 7.5 billion, compared to 21.5 billion blocked by the European Union.\nNot all property belonging to Russian citizens or towns in Switzerland is subject to sanctions. The protection of private property is a key value in Switzerland; the confiscations are rare and the criminal context must first be demonstrated.\nIn the past, this has repeatedly provoked tensions, especially with the United States, often in relation to the sanctions taken in the name of the \"war on terrorism\".\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe bizarre case of Youssef Nada and the role of Switzerland in the \"war on terrorism\". A retrospective.\nIn the letter, the ambassadors of the G7 express the \"preoccupation\" for the fact that the Swiss provisions on data protection, originally intended to protect those who resort to justice, are used to hide the traces of parked goods (\"financial shelter\"). They also fear that the protection of the private sphere prevent judicial authorities from investigating the illegal financial structures created and managed by lawyers, lawyers and specialized consultants.\nIn 2016, with the Panama Papers case, public opinion was able to make an idea of the importance of legal and notary studies in the creation of offshore structures. These are not in itself illegal, but are often used for money laundering, tax evasion or other global illegal activities, as these revelations have clearly shown. Swiss law firms were also involved in the scandal.\nIn 2019, the Federal Council proposed a review of the law on money laundering to introduce diligence and review obligations for lawyers, lawyers, notaries and notaries, as long requested by the International Financial Action Group (GAFI), an intergovernmental organization that fights against money laundering and terrorist financing.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland must change its mindset about transparency, says Tom Keatinge.\nIn Parliament, however, the proposal has clashed against a strong opposition and in the end a version of the text has been adopted much less incisive, which has strengthened only a small part of the legislation on this subject. It's not even a case here. Many people sitting in Parliament are their own lawyers or lawyers and many have strongly opposed the proposed amendments.\nThe finance minister of the time, Ueli Maurer, warned Parliament: \"If you exclude consultants, as the majority wants, we will return to office, I can assure you.\"\nThe result is that now the Federal Council is drawing up a new bill to broaden the law on money laundering as originally planned. Will this time be more successful in Parliament? You will know that during this year.\nThe Confederation has always been considered a crossroads of doubtful financial flows. An image that continues to tell the banks, although most of them are trying to work cleanerly, and this is not only when the banking secrecy has been abolished.\nAlthough the clich\u00e9s are hard to die, according to the GAFI, Switzerland is quite well involved in the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism: of the 40 recommendations of the institution, it meets completely or largely 35 and partially 5. The United States, for their part, does not satisfy at all 4.\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to receive our articles.\nDelaware, the State of origin of President Joe Biden, is considered a refuge in which to conceal funds and a stronghold of the companies of convenience. Here, as in other American states, it is relatively easy to bypass the Fatca rules (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) and the automatic exchange of information.\nSo when part of Swiss politics defines foreign pressure as unjust and motivated by political considerations, it is not necessarily wrong. The Panama Papers have shown this: There are global networks that serve to hide and transfer financial assets - and there are accomplices everywhere, in one form or another.\nSeveral factors explain why Swiss lawyers and lawyers are now under pressure. For years, the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism has been increasingly coordinated internationally, but Switzerland has done so far only the essential minimum. After the Russian invasion, the country suddenly found itself at the center of attention.\nThe Swiss authorities want to start a\nto discover more quickly cases of money laundering and financing of terrorism. It will be mainly an exchange of information between the public and private sectors which should allow for greater prevention.\nAs the Federal Council writes, 20 of the 30 most important financial centres in the world already have such a partnership. The initiative is mainly concerned with the banking sector, which seems to have welcomed the proposal.\nHowever, this would not solve the problem. There are other yards open. For example, the Swiss real estate market is subject to fraud due to lack of regulation. Especially since in Switzerland the prices of properties are high, it is relatively easy to use this market to recycle large sums of money.\nAlso in this case, transactions happen through banks and legal service providers. As long as intermediaries \u2013 lawyers, lawyers, notaries and notaries \u2013 will continue to have a wide and protected margin of manoeuvre, foreign criticism will not decrease.\nOther developments\n\nSwitzerland carries out a dangerous game of balancing with the EU from which it could be defeated.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

                    "In effetti, in questi ultimi giorni, la capitale della Lituania, che si trova a pochi chilometri dal centro geografico della \"grande\" Europa che va dagli Urali all'Atlantico, sembrava una fortezza pesantemente armata: pi\u00f9 di 12'000 forze di sicurezza civili e militari hanno fatto da cornice all'incontro annuale dell'alleanza di difesa.",
                    "All'aeroporto, le forze armate tedesche hanno persino posizionato diversi sistemi missilistici antiaerei Patriot.",
                    "Il vertice ha rappresentato un evento straordinario. A 500 giorni dall'inizio della guerra di aggressione russa contro l'Ucraina, la NATO si \u00e8 riorganizzata. A Vilnius sono stati concordati l'allargamento nell'Europa settentrionale e l'espansione delle relazioni nell'Indo-Pacifico, e all'Ucraina \u00e8 stata fatta la promessa di un processo di adesione.",
                    "La Confederazione, partner ufficiale della NATO dal 1997, non era presente a Vilnius. \"La Svizzera non \u00e8 stata invitata n\u00e9 come partecipante n\u00e9 come Paese osservatore\", indica il Dipartimento federale della difesa, della protezione della popolazione e dello sport (DDPS).",
                    "Ciononostante, la Svizzera \u00e8 interessata a una maggiore presenza e coinvolgimento nell'Alleanza. \"L'adesione degli Stati nordici libera posti nelle strutture di comando della NATO\", ha affermato\u00a0",

                    "Questo centro con sede a Ingolstadt, in Germania, sostiene la NATO e i suoi Stati partner nello sviluppo della strategia militare.",
                    "In effetti, secondo Pulli, l'adesione di Svezia e Finlandia alla NATO crea non solo nuove opportunit\u00e0, ma anche sfide per la Svizzera: \"Il gruppo di Stati europei partner della NATO \u00e8 diventato pi\u00f9 piccolo e ora ha meno peso nei confronti dell'Alleanza\".",
                    "La Svizzera, prosegue, sta quindi valutando la possibilit\u00e0 di \"partecipare all'intera gamma di esercitazioni, compresa la difesa collettiva ai sensi dell'articolo 5 del Trattato NATO\". In base a tale articolo, un attacco armato contro uno Stato alleato \u00e8 considerato un attacco contro tutti i Paesi dell'Alleanza.",
                    "Il motivo \u00e8 da ricercare nei recenti sviluppi geopolitici, sottolinea l'alta funzionaria: \"Se la Svizzera dovesse essere attaccata, gli obblighi legali in materia di neutralit\u00e0 non sarebbero pi\u00f9 applicabili e dovremmo quindi avere la possibilit\u00e0 di difenderci insieme ai nostri Stati partner, la maggior parte dei quali sono membri della NATO\".",
                    "Anche il rafforzamento della cooperazione internazionale dovrebbe servire a questo scopo. Dopo l'attacco della Russia all'Ucraina, una situazione del genere sembra infatti oggi pi\u00f9 plausibile, dice Pulli.",
                    "Qualsiasi avvicinamento alla NATO, sottolinea, potr\u00e0 per\u00f2 avvenire solo \"nel rispetto della neutralit\u00e0 e degli interessi degli Stati partner\". Questo solleva ovviamente una domanda: di quale forma di neutralit\u00e0 si parla?",
                    "\"Non esiste un codice di condotta fisso e stabilito per gli Stati neutrali. Possiamo definire l'applicazione della neutralit\u00e0 in modo ampiamente indipendente\", risponde Pulli. Ma \u00e8 anche chiaro che \"la fornitura diretta di armi a un Paese in guerra come l'Ucraina \u00e8 esclusa sotto il profilo\u00a0legale, cos\u00ec come l'obbligo di difesa comune\".",
                    "A Vilnius, appare chiaro quanto siano diventate urgenti le questioni di sicurezza collettiva. Incuneata tra l'exclave russa di Kaliningrad a ovest e la Bielorussia a sud, la Lituania presenta molte analogie con la Berlino della Guerra Fredda: a\u00a0soli 30 chilometri dalla capitale, un confine protetto da alte recinzioni separa la zona europea (democratica) da quella russa (autoritaria).",

                "en_content": "\"I wish I could always feel so safe,\" said Lithuanian President Gitanas Naus\u0117da on 11 July, at the opening of the two-day NATO summit in Vilnius.\nIn fact, in recent days, the capital of Lithuania, located a few kilometers from the geographical center of the \"great\" Europe that goes from the Urals to the Atlantic, seemed a heavily armed fortress: More than 12,000 civilian and military security forces have been framed for the annual meeting of the defence alliance.\nAt the airport, the German armed forces even placed several Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems.\nThe summit was an extraordinary event. At 500 days from the beginning of the Russian aggression war against Ukraine, NATO reorganized. In Vilnius, enlargement in northern Europe and the expansion of relations in the Indo-Pacific were agreed, and Ukraine was promised a process of accession.\nThe Confederation, an official NATO partner since 1997, was not present in Vilnius. \"Switzerland has not been invited as a participant or as an observer country,\" says the Federal Department of Defense, Protection of Population and Sports (DDPS).\nNevertheless, Switzerland is interested in greater presence and involvement in the Alliance. \"The accession of the free Nordic States to NATO command structures,\" he said.\n, head of DDPS security policy, contacted by SWI swissinfo.ch before the summit. \"Switzerland is also evaluating the possibility of sending staff to NATO's centres of excellence, such as the Center of Excellence for Military Engineering.\"\nThis centre, based in Ingolstadt, Germany, supports NATO and its partner states in developing the military strategy.\nIn fact, according to Pulli, the accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO creates not only new opportunities, but also challenges for Switzerland: \"The group of European NATO partner states has become smaller and now has less weight towards the Alliance.\"\nSwitzerland is therefore considering the possibility of \"participating in the entire range of exercises, including collective defence under Article 5 of the NATO Treaty\". According to this article, an attack against an allied state is considered an attack against all the countries of the Alliance.\nThe reason is to be found in recent geopolitical developments, underlines the high official: \"If Switzerland should be attacked, legal neutrality obligations would no longer apply and we should therefore have the opportunity to defend ourselves with our partner states, most of which are NATO members.\"\nThe strengthening of international cooperation should also serve this purpose. After Russia's attack on Ukraine, such a situation seems more plausible today, says Pulli.\nAny approach to NATO, however, points out, can only happen \"in compliance with neutrality and the interests of the partner States\". This obviously raises a question: what kind of neutrality is this about?\n\"There is no fixed code of conduct established for neutral states. We can define the application of neutrality largely independently,\" says Pulli. But it is also clear that \"the direct supply of weapons to a country in war as Ukraine is excluded from the legal profile, as well as the obligation of common defence\".\nIn Vilnius, it seems clear how urgent the issues of collective security have become. Nestled between the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad to the west and Belarus to the south, Lithuania has many similarities with the Cold War Berlin: only 30 kilometers from the capital, a border protected by high fences separates the European zone (democratic) from the Russian one (authoritarian).\nOther developments\nDebate\nNeutrality is on the test bench of world history. Do you have a future? And how should it be defined?\nDuring an inspection at the border of Medininkai, SWI swissinfo.ch met many people who fled from Iraq and Syria from Belarus on a bike. They don't want to answer questions or take pictures. According to Finnish security expert Rasmus Hindren, they are part of \"a hybrid war, as we have observed for years at the various external borders of the European Union\".\nWhile Lithuania (65,000 square kilometers and 2.8 million inhabitants) used the summit days to relate the war of Russia in Ukraine and its security interests, at the Vilnius meeting there was no trace of Switzerland and its concerns in this regard.\nOther developments\n\nA milestone in vacilla democracy.

According to the Swiss Association of Commodity Trade and Maritime Transport, 80% of cereals produced in the world is negotiated in the Geneva region by the five main raw material companies: Archer Daniel Midlands (ADM), Bunge, Cargill, Cofco and Louis Dreyfus.\n\"Only because a country is sanctioned, it does not mean that trade disappears. \"\n, President of the Iran-Switzerland Chamber of Commerce\nWestern sanctions imposed on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 coincided with a serious shortage of grain in Iran, which made imports from Iran impede\n. This year, the number of Russian companies enrolled at an annual grain conference in Iran has risen sharply, said Nezam-Mafi.\nIran is also subjected to international sanctions since 1979. The last series of sanctions was set in 2006, after the country refused to end its uranium enrichment program.\nTrade in agricultural products is free from international sanctions for humanitarian reasons (see box). In Geneva, who is active in this sector confirms that the main agricultural traders and inspection companies have licenses that allow them to facilitate the trade of grain between Russia and Iran and maintain a presence in Tehran.\nIn 2021, Iran's national grain production was\n, which forced the country to resort to imports to compensate for lack. Iran has become the\nin\n, when Russian exports\ndue to the uncertainty of banks and shipping companies on how to react to international sanctions.\nIn July 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department extended the general licences on agricultural transactions, reasserting that cereals are not subject to the regime of sanctions against Russia. In a statement on food safety, the United States aims to bring essential goods such as wheat to \"reduce the impact of Russia's un provoked war against Ukraine on global food supplies and prices\". A previous communication, published in April 2022, at a time when the prices of wheat were at the stars, specified that the United States did not intend to hinder agricultural exports.\nIn August 2022 Switzerland adopted new rules to allow transactions with Russian companies, when they are considered necessary for humanitarian trade. The Federal Council also introduced the possibility of defrosting the assets of sanctioned entities if considered essential for grain transactions.\nThe supplies are partly resumed because Moscow wanted to diversify its export markets. But Iran remained among the top three destinations, absorbing 15% of overseas grain sales in 2021 and 13% in 2022, according to Kpler data, a company that analyzes the evolution of commodity markets.\nIn previous periods of shortage on the internal market, Iran imported grain from\n, including Germany. But in the last two years the dependence on Russia has increased: in 2021, 83% of the imports of wheat arrived from that country, 72% in 2022, according to the data compiled by Kpler.\nThe \"five big\" cereal traders are reluctant to openly discuss the subject. When SWI swissinfo.ch asked ADM for a comment on his activities, a spokesman was limited to saying that the company \"works globally, linking crops and markets to more than 190 countries and respecting all imposed regulations and sanctions\".\nIn his financial statement of 2022, Louis Dreyfus declared that he had suspended operations in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, but had resumed them \"as far as possible, with the aim of satisfying the commitments and demand of customers, in compliance with all sanctions, laws and regulations\". In April,\nreported that the company planned to discontinue Russian grain exports from July 2023, but a spokesman contacted by SWI swissinfo.ch refused to comment or provide further details about Iran.\nBunge, Cargill and Cosco did not respond to our repeated urges to know if sanctions for humanitarian reasons allowed them to facilitate the trade in grain between Russia and Iran.\nEven with humanitarian licenses, cereal trade with Iran is difficult. \"Most people have no idea how difficult it is to do business in one of the most sanctioned countries in the world,\" said SWI swissinfo.ch.\n, member of the Governing Council of the Middle East and Africa region of the International Mugnai Association, during the Geneva Conference.\nOne of the key issues is payment, because the financial sanctions in force for a long time have prevented Iran from accessing the international banking system. \"There are two problems when it comes to banking with Iran,\" he says.\n, economist and founder of the Bourse & Bazaar Foundation, a think tank based in London that deals with Middle East and Central Asia.\n\"Most people have no idea how difficult it is to do business in one of the most sanctioned countries in the world. \"\n, International Association of Mugnai\n\"First of all, very few Iranian banks have banking correspondence with European institutions or any other bank,\" he explains. Most international banks are reluctant to maintain relations with countries subjected to sanctions, even for humanitarian goods. The importing companies of Iranian wheat struggle to find a bank channel to make payments to those who export, says Batmanghelidj.\nSecondly, access to strong currencies is limited. \"The problem is that the Iranian Central Bank (CBI) has undergone the freezing of most of its foreign reserves and oil money that Iran used to finance its trade is no longer easily accessible,\" explains Batmanghelidj. The United States has\nin humanitarian trade to fight against money laundering and terrorist financing.\nThe CBI is also at the centre of a\nfor essential goods such as grain, which offers traders a preferential exchange rate that allows them to import at lower costs. But the central bank failed to meet strong currency demand in a timely manner. The result is that the ships carrying the grain remained\noutside the Iranian ports for months, waiting for payment of their cargos (see map).\nIn recent years\nthey rose to the stars in Iran because of the collapse of the national currency and the cut of subsidies from the government. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) calculated that the number of Iranians and Iranians who cannot afford healthy food rose to 17,1 million in 2020 - more than 20% of the population - compared to 9,6 million in 2017.\n\"Iran is not a country where there is a serious food crisis, but sanctions have created a context in which the accessibility and availability of essential goods, including foodstuffs, are not guaranteed,\" says Batmanghelidj.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe commodity trade is essential, but controversial. That\u2019s how Switzerland has become a global player of industry weight.\nWheat is not the only manifestation of the increasing links between Russia and Iran. Moscow showed\nfor the development of new commercial routes. Diplomacy is in ferment, with several presidential meetings only in 2022. Just a month after the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Minister committed to working with Iran to circumvent international sanctions. The rapprochement has alarmed the United States, whose absolute priority is to stop the supply of weapons between the two countries.\nOne of the main projects is the North-South International Transport Corridor (INSTC), which aims to connect Russia to India through Central Asia and Iran. The network of railways, highways and maritime routes through and around the Caspian Sea should be more direct than the winding path through the seas of the North and the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal,\nof the transport of goods.\nAlthough the project has been under discussion for over 20 years, Western sanctions have reinvigorated Russia's interest. A proof batch of goods was shipped from St. Petersburg through the Caspian Sea in Mumbai in June 2022. Meanwhile, Iran is\nto the Eurasian Economic Union, a free trade bloc composed of several former Soviet states.\nMoscow and Tehran would have worked to establish\nto circumvent the international system dominated by the West and Russia became the largest investor in Iran. The two-thirds of foreign direct investment in the country between January and March 2023, amounting to $2.76 billion, came from Russia, according to the Iranian Ministry of Finance.\nHowever, this Russian-Iranian friendship has limits. INSTC railway lines are incomplete and, although maritime routes are operational, the loading capacity on the Caspian Sea is limited.\nEconomist Esfandyar Batmanghelidj doubts that the intensification of relations with Russia can change the charts at the table for Iran. \"There are still banking restrictions,\" he says. \"It will be very difficult for Russia and Iran to create a supply chain that complies with the impossibility of buying essential goods on the global market.\"\nOther developments\n\nLike many other developed countries, Switzerland is confronted with an important shortage of personnel in many sectors.\nYet, corporate leaders who attended the grain conference in Geneva have seen many opportunities to increase regional trade. From the Iranian point of view, the bite of markets and Western approaches is loosening.\nArticles mentioned\nSeries Switzerland and sanctions against Russia\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

                "en_content": "Will Switzerland enter NATO? This scenario still seems far away. However, for a year we have been discussing a closer collaboration with the military alliance, an approach supported by almost all political groups. The question of the moment is: how far should Switzerland go?\nThe Confederation is not the only neutral country in Europe to question. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has permanently overwhelmed European security architecture and NATO's defensive alliance, after years of disorientation, is tightening the ranks. Neutral and unified states in Europe are looking for their position in the conflict - and most are approaching NATO in one way or another.\nThe most radical step is that of the two Nordic States,\nand\n, who decided to enter NATO.\nIn 2023, Finland was the 31st State to join NATO. Since he became a member of the European Union in 1995, he no longer defines himself as neutral, but a country not aligned. This statute has always been seen more as a necessary concession in the face of a near bully, Russia, than as a decision of an ethical nature.\nIt was a realpolitik decision to maintain its sovereignty towards the Soviet Union. This so-called \"Finlandization\" was progressively abandoned after the end of the Cold War.\nSweden also decided to join NATO, just over two months after the Russian invasion of Ukraine - a break with the traditional neutrality that the Scandinavian country had cultivated for two centuries. But the path to NATO was not so direct: Turkey and Hungary had advanced requests and blocked the accession process in an attempt to acquire a certain political influence. Last week, during the NATO summit in Vilnius, Turkey secured its support and Sweden should become the 32nd Alliance country in the coming months.\nFor NATO, the accession of the two Nordic States is not only important from the symbolic point of view, but also from the military one: Finland has a highly equipped army and shares a frontier of 1'340 kilometers with Russia, while Sweden has a strong war industry.\nIn 1994,\nentered the \"permanent neutrality\" clause in its Constitution. This is partly due to internal policy reasons: The multiethnic state, of which Transnistria was also a member, sought to achieve a social balance through a non-alignment policy which would be accepted by the whole population.\nAccording to the polls, the majority of the population still supports this neutrality. The first controversial discussions took place after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and intensified after the Russian invasion of all Ukraine in 2022. The focus is on EU membership and the country does not explicitly want to enter NATO.\nIn 2007,\nA militarily neutral state was declared, also recognized by NATO, against which that decision was directed. Like Moldova, Serbia did not adopt sanctions against Russia and politically maneuver between the West and the East - in the tradition of the Movement of Unified Countries, which was the state doctrine of the former Yugoslavia.\nThe small state of\nentered neutrality in its Constitution in 1987. This is a late consequence of decolonization: the former British colony was considered part of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, which distanced itself from the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Today neutrality is undisputed and Malta is the only EU member country not to participate in the permanent structured cooperation PESCO, the joint European defence project.\nEven the\nIt was a British colony and its neutrality was proclaimed by the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which sanctioned Irish independence. Unlike other neutral countries in Europe, Ireland has minimal defensive capabilities and interprets its \"military neutrality\" in a less rigid way.\nHowever, this aspect has become controversial lately: the cyber attacks on the health system by Russian hackers in 2021 (in the middle of the pandemic) relativized the geographical isolation of the country. Moreover, along its Atlantic coast pass submarine cables essential for global communications. Ireland has therefore launched a public consultation to discuss the future of its neutrality: an approach to NATO is certainly considered an option.\nThe situation is different for\n, whose neutrality is not internationally recognized. The country traditionally has close ties with Russia: the Soviet Union was considered an important military partner since the invasion of Turkey, a NATO state in 1974. However, membership of NATO is impossible because the territorial conflict remains unresolved and Turkey - which does not recognize the country - would immediately veto.\nCritical voices within the country say that\nis \"a NATO exploiter\" - the same charge is felt in Switzerland. There is also another important point in common: neutrality as an identity element. Unlike Switzerland, however, Austrian neutrality is anchored in the Constitution. This is the result of negotiations on the withdrawal of employment forces after World War II: the Soviets demanded the \"perpetual neutrality\" of the country, while the Allies accepted any armed neutrality on the Swiss model.\nThe complete abandonment of neutrality and accession to NATO find little support in Austria. But the country, like Switzerland, participates in the Partnership for Peace (PfP) and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership (EAPC). These allow cooperation with NATO and each participating nation can independently determine the scope of this cooperation. Together with Switzerland, Austria now wants to participate in the European Sky Shield air defense system. That would be the only two non-NATO states to be part of this initiative.\nIn\n, it is not only neutrality to be perennial, but also the discussion around it. From the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine, we are discussing how Switzerland should place itself in the war. The Confederacy has adopted sanctions against Russia, sends humanitarian aid to Ukraine and generally supports the West. However, financial aid to Ukraine is relatively small, as in the case of other neutral states. Above all, NATO member states provide money and military support.\nThe fact that Switzerland has banned European countries from bringing back its war material has provoked discontent. According to the most frequent criticisms, the Confederation hides behind its neutrality and continues to profit from economic interweavings, without taking sufficiently incisive measures against the Russian oligarchy.\nThe accusation of opportunism, however, is not new and is not limited to Switzerland. The neutral states with a clearly Western orientation have benefited from the NATO shield, without having to do anything in return.\nThe Federal Defence Department argues that the capacity for cooperation of the Swiss armed forces - known as interoperability - should be greatly strengthened. In security environments, the Russian attack on Ukraine made a military connection with NATO more urgent.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland wants more cooperation with NATO, but this would lead to the Treaty for the prohibition of nuclear weapons.\nAs the air defence system demonstrates, the defence policy of the continent is consolidating: the EU, NATO and neutral countries cooperate more closely at different levels. To silence those who are skeptical, it is underlined that in these constellations there is no need for assistance.\nFrom the Russian point of view, however, it is a secondary question: Moscow no longer considers Switzerland a neutral country because of sanctions and ranked it as a \" hostile State\".\nOther developments\n\nSwitzerland carries out a dangerous game of balancing with the EU from which it could be defeated.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

With the scene exit of Prigozhin, it could be the end of Wagner's activities in those countries,\" he says.\n\"I think the situation could be different in Africa, where Wagner really operated as a commercial actor. There is demand for Wagner's services and local elites are willing to pay by public money or by other means. I don't see another security provider that can take over, at least in the short term, and offer the same kind of services to countries, especially in Africa,\" says Rousseau.\nWagner is known for his significant presence in fragile states such as the Central African Republic, where he was accused of looting mineral resources and abuse against the civilian population. It is also present in Mali and Burkina Faso, a theatre in the recent past of military strikes. Following the 26 July coup in Niger, some protesters openly called for Wagner's arrival in the country. This is seen as part of the growing anti-Western feeling in some parts of Africa, that Russia is eager to exploit.\nIn fact, Prigozhin, in a video broadcast on social media just before his death, appeared on a desert background, meaning he was in Africa. He talked about making Russia bigger on all continents and Africa more \"free\".\n\"I think that, especially in fragile countries, where we see groups like Wagner working, there is no capacity to regulate them, monitor them and believe them responsible,\" says Rousseau. \"The discussion on Prigozhin and Wagner should act as a catalyst. Wagner exploited the gaps of the system to carry out his activities and, if we want to avoid a new Wagner group, these gaps must be filled\".\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nIn the 19th century, young Swiss of modest origins played part in the dirty work of foreign colonial forces in Asia and Africa.\nRousseau explains that Switzerland is among the main countries for the development of better regulation.

He was President of Estonia (2006-2016) and Member of the European Parliament. Parents fled to the United States after the invasion and occupation of the Baltic States by the Soviet Union in 1940.\n: I found it very strange when the Swiss President [Alain Berset] said: \"We cannot export weapons that will be used at war.\" So why manufacture weapons? I mean, do you produce museum pieces? What's the point? If so, close your weapons industry. [The Swiss] have become ridiculous.\nNuclear weapons become old, as well as their technology.\nFirst, let us admit it, it is very easy to be neutral when it is surrounded by NATO. Secondly, I do not think that the Swiss Government is attracted by many sympathy from the countries that have been invaded, like mine. Estonia was a neutral country and in 1939-1940 it was first invaded by the Russians, then by the Nazis and then by the Russians. Neutrality is a good thing to have if you are around NATO, but it does not work.\nHe practically managed to destroy the last vestiges of democracy in Russia and eliminated all forms of opposition, resorting to detention or murder. This is the impact. We're dealing with an almost totalitarian dictatorship.\nWell, of course, at least as far as technology is concerned. Why do Russian soldiers in Ukraine have to import huge amounts of refrigerators and washing machines? It's because they can't get the chips to put in the teleguided missiles. So, in this sense, yes, technological sanctions seem to have effect. And it also seems that Russia is working happily to bypass the sanctions on oil. The sanctions need time to have effect.\nOther developments\n\nSwitzerland carries out a dangerous game of balancing with the EU from which it could be defeated.\nIn the meantime, however, there is the broken-sanction action of Turkey, Kazakhstan and Armenia. This is always a problem. There may be agreements between the European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea and so on, but countries like Armenia, Turkey and Kazakhstan always try to profit.\nThe only things Putin respects are strength and power. What we have to do is stop holding. It has come a long way since last February when Germany supplied 5'000 helmets to Ukraine. But it is quite clear that without serious military support, Ukraine cannot win.\nKiev would be almost completely destroyed today, if Ukraine had not had the Patriot missiles to break down the missiles directed towards the city. There is a need for strong support from the West. Even here, again, the West played the self-dissuasion card. Putin threatens to use atomic weapons and everyone says: \"Oh no, we can't let Ukrainians have more material.\" Then the West slowly realizes that if you provide anti-tank missiles and anti-missile material does not break the Third World War.\nAnd even more importantly, what the West does not understand enough is that, if you do not help Ukraine, you can throw in the garbage the last 80 years of international law, because Putin is practically saying to the civilized world: \"I can invade and there are no consequences.\"\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to receive our articles.\nI don't think that makes sense a de-escalation right now. Because this means allowing Russia to control and strengthen the defence of the territory that it has occupied illegally. I would say that now it takes the opposite \u2013 a very strong push to free the occupied areas of Ukraine, especially since we know that when Russia occupies a territory commits the most horrible war crimes.\nSo when I hear people say, \"We must have a de-escalation and a ceasefire,\" he says, in practice: \"Go ahead, Russia. Kill, rape, torture.\" So \"de-escalation\" is a word you can say while you are a bathtub sipping a glass of ros\u00e9 wine. But we're talking about torture victims and rapes.\nWhat I see in Europe is a division between countries that have experienced the Soviet occupation and countries that have done so. In Estonia, everyone has a relative, a grandfather, a grandmother, someone who suffered under the Soviet yoke. People call the Estonian minister [Kaja Kallas] a \"falco\". His mother had six months of life when [in 1940] she was deported to a cattle car in Siberia, where she remained until seven years, then returning to Estonia. The assumption of people who have never passed from this kind of experience and tells us that we do not know how to deal with Russia is hateful. It's revolting.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nBeijing wants to promote its vision of human rights. A battle that takes place in the halls of the Palace of Nations in Geneva.\nWell, I'm talking about the inability, especially Western and European politicians, to understand what's going on and not to give the right weight to the experiences that people in the East have experienced. This has bothered me since she read a review\nof\nby Alexander Solzhenitsyn. The reviewer said: \"Solzhenitsyn doesn't know what he's talking about.\" This is the peculiar inability of people to understand what happened. Western politicians could preach to us for years about how they know how to get along with the Russians when they have no experience with the Russians.\nWe're at war. We all make sacrifices at war. We pay higher energy costs because we do not use Russian gas and oil. There's an impact on everyone. The short-term problems of people simply do not matter when it comes to crimes against humanity committed right now in Ukraine.\nThese exceptions already exist. It's not a problem. As you know, there are no restrictions on humanitarian assistance. And they have always existed, even in the case of sanctions against Iran.\nI think Ukrainian people shouldn't be affected by Russian war crimes. I don't care who can be disturbed by sanctions when there are ongoing war crimes in Ukraine. And I don't even see these people protest. If that's the case, protest! Maybe they'll change my mind.\nYeah, people in prison. Ma\nseems that support for war has grown in Russia. Dimitri Peskov's daughter is still an intern in the European Parliament. And I'm\n,\nyou give to the crazy shopping in Paris, it is left to enter and spend thousands of euros. These things shouldn't happen.\nI really don't know anything about the business that Swiss banks do with Russia. But I know that the Raiffeisen International Bank [Austrian banking institute, ndr] is granting loans to Russian soldiers. For my part, I would sanction all the banks that help Russia.\n\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

                "en_content": "\"The candidacy of Russia is a cynical attempt to return to the Council following the suspension decided by the General Assembly\nin response to the invasion of Ukraine,\" explained the NGO based in Geneva International Service for Human Rights (ISHR) in a press release on September 4.\nIn April of last year, shortly after the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia became the second country in history (after Gaddafi's Libya) to be suspended by the Council for Human Rights, so that the majority of two-thirds of the UN General Assembly was necessary. Now, she ran for another warrant.\nOnly the 47 members of the Council have the right to vote, which means that they are the only ones who decide, for example, what countries will be scrutiny and criticised for the way they defend or violate human rights.\nMarc Limon, Director of Universal Rights Group, headquartered in Geneva, says that electing Russia as a member would be \"actually completely wrong\". \"If the General Assembly suspends a country for serious and systematic violations of human rights and then re-elected it while violations continue and there was no responsibility, it would be a disaster for the credibility of the Council for Human Rights and for that of the United Nations in general,\" says SWI swissinfo.ch.\nThe Council elections are held in regional groups. The central and eastern European group has three candidates for two seats: Albania, Bulgaria and Russia. Limon explains that Russia has been campaigning for a long time and Albania has just applied \u2013 probably under the pressure of Western states.\nHuman rights organizations also oppose China's candidacy, which is currently a member of the Council and intends to obtain a second mandate. Organizations recall the UN report published a year ago, which made possible crimes against humanity against the Uyghur community in the province of Xinjiang and Beijing's poor human rights behaviour in Tibet and Hong Kong.\nResolution 6251 of the UN General Assembly, which created the Human Rights Council in 2006, states that \"the members elected to the Council must respect the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights\" and \" fully cooperate with the Council\". This is not the case of Russia or China.\nUnlike Russia, China has no competition in its regional group, where there are four candidates for four seats. It seems therefore that it will be re-elected, but according to Salma El Hosseiny, of ISHR, states can still resist. \"States are not obliged to vote for all candidates, even in a case like this,\" says SWI swissinfo.ch. \"Do not vote for candidates who do not meet the requirements, a strong message is sent, even if they were eventually elected.\"\nThe ISHR also calls for an end to closed lists. \"It's a problem,\" says Hosseiny, \"one of our main appeals is that regional groups should submit a greater number of applications than the available seats, so that elections are competitive.\"\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nBeijing wants to promote its vision of human rights. A battle that takes place in the halls of the Palace of Nations in Geneva.\nA UN Committee of Inquiry on Ukraine, created by mandate of the Human Rights Council, stated in March that Russia committed \"a multitude\" of war crimes in Ukraine and allegedly also crimes against humanity. In an update report to the Council, presented\nIt also stated that the commission is affecting the charges of genocide committed in Ukraine. \"Part of rhetoric used by state media and not in Russia, could be incite to genocide,\" we read.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian presidential commissioner for the rights of children, Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, were charged by the International Criminal Tribunal for the crime of forced deportation of children.\nThe UN Special Envoy for Human Rights in Russia, Mariana Katzarov, in September spoke of a repression of a \"unprevious\" flow from the times of Stalin.\nGiven all this, Russian candidacy might seem like \"a joke\", as the human rights defender Hassan Shine writes in a published lane\n. \"And a joke of even more bad taste would be to see elected Russia,\" he adds. However, that this happens is not impossible.\nLimon says that states should, in theory, vote according to the criteria already mentioned, but in reality it is rather a bargaining that takes place within various international organizations in favour of an application. Russia has prepared the road in this sense and Limon thinks that Moscow is no longer completely isolated as it was last year, when all attention was focused on the newly invaded Ukraine.\nThe expert thinks that the seat is now what made for Bulgaria and that between Albania and Russia the margin is minimal. \"I'm very, very concerned,\" says SWI swissinfo.ch. If Russia is elected, Limon thinks, this could put into question the very future of the Human Rights Council. The Director of Universal Rights Group recalls that the main reason for the collapse of the Commission on human rights, which preceded the Council, was precisely the presence in it of countries which seriously violated human rights.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe Human Rights Council is the UN body for the promotion and defence of human rights.\nOther developments\n\nSwitzerland carries out a dangerous game of balancing with the EU from which it could be defeated.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

Although Hamas has been designated as such by several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and the European Union (EU), the previous attempts of some members of the Swiss Parliament in this sense have all failed.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe Federal Council has commissioned the Middle East task force to assess legal options to ban the Palestinian organization.\n\"On the basis of the law in force in Switzerland, this step can only be accomplished if the United Nations Security Council designates Hamas as a terrorist organization, which has not done. Therefore, the Confederation must create a special legislation which must be approved by Parliament,\" said Marco Sassoli, professor of international law at the University of Geneva.\nEven in this case it is unlikely that it is a permanent ban.

Switzerland contributes CHF 20 million a year to the ordinary budget of the United Nations Agency for the relief and occupation of Palestinian refugees in the Middle East (UNRWA) and finances approximately 30 NGOs in the Palestinian territory (5 million francs in 2022). According to Sassoli, it would be almost impossible to ensure that all these organizations have nothing to do with Hamas.\n\"We condemn Hamas' attack, but this organization continues to manage the Gaza Strip. If you want to deliver food, medicine or help children, you need to talk to Hamas. You can't get by helicopter!\", says Sassoli.\nThe EU still manages to send aid to Palestine despite having entered Hamas in the list of terrorist groups already in 2003, a decision that has been successfully contested several times in court. However, the recent attack prompted European assistance to be reviewed urgently.\n\"Our humanitarian support to the Palestinian people is not in question. However, it is important to carefully review our financial assistance. EU funding has never gone and will never go to Hamas or any terrorist entity. We shall now review the entire portfolio in the light of developments in the field,\" said Mr Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission on Wednesday.\nSwitzerland, however, is in a better position than the EU to draw up Hamas on the list of terrorist organizations and continue to provide essential aid to the Palestinian population.\n\"If Switzerland approves special legislation designating Hamas as a terrorist group, it should provide an exception clause to offer neutral humanitarian service to the population. An exception of this type is already present in the Swiss Criminal Code, which prohibits activities considered to support terrorism,\" says Sassoli.\nIt refers to Article 260 of the Swiss Criminal Code dealing with penises for support of \"criminal or terrorist organizations\". The article provides an exception, since \"it does not apply to humanitarian services provided by an impartial humanitarian organization, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, in accordance with Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949\".\nThe most thorny question will be to get the money to the people in need in Palestine through the federal financial system.\n\"Even with an exception to humanitarian assistance, you will have an indirect freezing effect. No bank will transfer money to a place run by a group placed in a terrorist list,\" says Sassoli.\nReputation and integrity are key factors for the Swiss financial centre, says Robert Reinecke, spokesman of the Swiss Bankers Association.\n\"Anti-recycling measures have been constantly expanded and strengthened in recent years. Banks are subject to complete obligations of\nand\nto prevent money laundering and financial crime,\" he says.\nCatalonia Hamas as a terrorist organization could also compromise Switzerland's ability to act as a mediator in the Middle East. The neutrality of the Confederation has made it a trusted partner in the region: Switzerland is currently the diplomatic interests of Iran in Egypt and Canada, the United States in Iran and Iran in Saudi Arabia (and vice versa).\nIn 2021, responding to a parliamentary question, the Helvetic Government indicated that relations with Israel and Hamas also rest on good grounds.\nAccording to Sassoli, Switzerland's diplomatic burden in the region would be affected if Hamas was included in the list of terrorist organizations.\n\"There are negotiations with the United States on Israeli hostages involving Turkey and Qatar. It will be difficult for Switzerland to play a role in these negotiations if Hamas is considered a terrorist organization,\" the professor of international law concludes.\nOther developments\n\nSwitzerland carries out a dangerous game of balancing with the EU from which it could be defeated.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

                "en_content": ":\nUntil recent developments, the dialogue with Hamas, despite the world\u2019s opinion on this organization, has enabled Switzerland to mediate effectively during past conflicts and negotiations, and this is precisely thanks to its neutrality. To declare Hamas a terrorist organization is in contradiction with the historical neutrality of the country and its role as mediator.\nBy doing so, Switzerland would risk influencing its ability to act and perform mediation work in regional conflicts and future negotiations, such as for the release of hostages or to facilitate dialogue between the parties.\nSwitzerland should leverage its tradition of neutrality and mediation without deploying with Israel or Palestine. It is possible to recognize that both parties may have committed war crimes, as demonstrated by Hamas' actions and Israel's response. Switzerland can provide a valuable service and warn against a potential depletion of hostilities, such as an invasion by Israel in Gaza, underlining the risk of war crimes multiplying. In order to do this, however, the Swiss Minister of Foreign Affairs must have the necessary strength and determination, and this aspect of concern given the current apparent weakness.\nSure. Following the 1993 Oslo Agreements (including Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization), Switzerland set up a group of diplomats and diplomats who worked effectively. Today that political will is a distant memory: the Swiss diplomatic corps is in smaller numbers and is not equally prepared. For Swiss diplomacy in the region this is a problem not recently.\nThe population of Gaza exceeds two million inhabitants, most of whom are refugees who benefit from UNRWA\u2019s help (the United Nations Agency for the Rescue and Employment of Palestinian Refugees in the Near East), partly funded by Switzerland. The UNRWA, the only United Nations agency providing humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees and refugees, unlike UNHCR, which deals with legal protection.\nOther developments\n\nSwitzerland carries out a dangerous game of balancing with the EU from which it could be defeated.\nIt should not be forgotten that the more than six million Palestinian refugees and refugees in the region have no legal protection and are therefore particularly vulnerable worldwide.\nUNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) and UNRWA (United Nations Agency for Relief and Employment of Palestinian Refugees in the Near East) both deal with refugee issues, but have separate mandates and operational areas, especially with regard to the Palestinian people:\n\u2022 UNHCR: established in 1950, its main purpose is to protect and support refugee people worldwide. It offers assistance to those who are refugee, apolides and, in some cases, to internally displaced persons, regardless of their nationality or origin.\n\u2022 UNRWA: Founded in 1949, it has the exclusive mandate to provide assistance, protection and patronage specifically to Palestinian refugee people who have lost their homes and means of subsistence due to the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict.\n\u2022 UNHCR: operates globally in various countries affected by displacement.\n\u2022 UNRWA: Works specifically in five areas: West Bank, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.\n\u2022 UNHCR: a refugee is a person forced to flee his country due to persecution, war or violence. The 1951 Refugee Convention is the main definition used by UNHCR.\n\u2022 UNRWA: Uses a more specific definition. A Palestinian refugee is a person \"whose place of habitual residence was Palestine in the period between 1 June 1946 and 15 May 1948, and who lost both the house and the means of sustenance because of the 1948 conflict\".\n\u2022 UNHCR: provides legal protection, asylum application procedures, fields, emergency interventions and resettlement services.\n\u2022 UNRWA: It offers a wide range of services, including education, healthcare, social services, infrastructure and fields improvement, microfinance and emergency interventions.\nBy cutting humanitarian aid, Switzerland would commit a diplomatic suicide. What base would it stop the provision of humanitarian aid? It is not possible to prove that Hamas takes the money for aid. The allocation of international assistance in Gaza has become a sophisticated mechanism, which guarantees in-depth checks regarding those who benefit from aid and how funds are spent.\nThe European Union, which provides important financial aid, uses a specific mechanism called\nIn order to ensure that the funds will end with the associations and institutions to which they were intended. Therefore, even if there may be episodes of financial maladministration, any charge should be suffragated by clear examples instead of spreading claims without foundation.\nNow, the solution of the two states seems to be invariable. The current Israeli logic provides a single state. In the legal context, Israel under the administration of the occupied territories has established laws that discriminate and separate Palestinian people and force them to leave their homes. The question of racial discrimination in Israel has become increasingly important since 2017, when\nwhich accuses Israel of imposing an apartheid regime against the Palestinian population.\n\n\n\n\nMicheline Calmy-Rey's opinion on Swiss neutrality against the war in Ukraine.\nThe failure of the solution of the two states, as demonstrated by the difficulties that have characterized the Geneva Initiative (launched in 2003 by the will of Israeli and Palestinian civil society), suggests that alternative solutions, such as a federalist model, should be considered. The opening to new models of building peace, such as the federalist one, largely depends on the willingness of the parties involved to overcome the usual political and territorial positions. The question is complex and multifaceted, and demands a certain commitment at international and local level.\nVarious Palestinian and Israeli organizations are examining alternative models. These include the \"solution with a single democratic State\", the one with a \"binational State\" and the one with a \"federation\". However, as an accomplice to the current conflict, it is currently difficult to deepen these options in detail and to propel for one of them. Before becoming more involved in this analysis it is essential to wait for the outcome of the war.\nThe difference should be sought in legal and constitutional architecture. Israel, which is defined as a Jewish democratic state without an organic constitution, moves between delicate religious and political balances. A \"Unified Democratic State\" would imply that all citizens enjoy the same status, regardless of whether they are Jewish or Palestinian, as well as a well-defined constitution that guarantees equal rights. On the contrary, a \"binational state\" could involve different political structures for the two national groups, but it should be conscientiously planned to avoid internal conflicts and ensure equal representation of rights for all and all. To explore these models it is necessary to consider carefully the different religious and political perspectives present in the region.\nA \"binational State\" would also imply that the right to self-determination is recognized both for people of Jewish origin and for those of Palestinian origin; look, this, which surprisingly has never been declared officially. In the 2018 State-nation bill, Israel stated that only Israelis and Israelis of Jewish origin are entitled to self-determination. However, this right was crucial during the process of decolonization of other regions such as Africa and India.\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletter to receive our articles.\nLooking at the efforts made in the past, such as those following the Oslo agreements, you can draw an important lesson on the need to apply and strictly respect international law in the processes of building peace. Despite the agreements, after 1994 Israel was able to confiscate territories with ever greater frequency without interventions or significant consequences from the international community. Europe and the United States have not been able to ensure that the factions involved strictly respected international law and norms. From all this we should learn that it is essential to consider the parties responsible for their actions. States must comply with legal and ethical standards; should not allow its geopolitical or diplomatic relations to soften the needs of legitimate and impartial practices in the context of the resolution of international conflicts.\nArticles mentioned\nIn accordance with JTI standards\nOther developments:",

                    "Auch die im Ausland lebenden Schweizer:innen w\u00e4hlten in diesem Jahr massiv weniger f\u00fcr die Gr\u00fcnen: In allen zw\u00f6lf Kantonen, die separate Statistiken zur Diaspora-Stimmabgabe liefern, verliert die Gr\u00fcne Partei 5,4 Prozentpunkte ihres W\u00e4hleranteils und f\u00e4llt von der st\u00e4rksten Partei 2019 (mit 23,8% der Stimmen) auf den dritten Platz in diesem Jahr (mit 18,4%).",
                    "Obwohl die F\u00fcnfte Schweiz traditionell eher klimafreundlicher w\u00e4hlt als der Rest der Schweiz, verzeichnen die Gr\u00fcnen also einen R\u00fcckgang der Stimmen. Dies hat laut Martina Mousson, Politologin des\u00a0",
                    ", genau wie in der Schweiz mit der aktuellen Themenlage zu tun.",
                    "Diese sei bei diesen Wahlen grundlegend anders gewesen als vor vier Jahren. \"Obwohl das Klimathema immer noch eine\u00a0der Hauptsorgen ist, war es offensichtlich kein wahlrelevantes Thema. Es wurde von anderen Themen \u00fcberlagert\", so Mousson. Sie nennt globale Themen wie\u00a0der Ukraine-Krieg, die Wirtschaftslage, die Konjunktur, die Teuerung. \"Davon ist nicht nur die Schweiz betroffen\", sagt die Politologin.",
                    "Anders als im Inland kann man hingegen nicht sagen, dass die SVP auf Seiten der Auslandschweizer:innen an der Urne triumphiert hat.",
                    "Die rechtskonservative Partei ist die gr\u00f6sste politische Kraft des Landes und hat in diesem Jahr auch am meisten zugelegt (9 Sitze und 28,6% der Stimmen, ein Plus von 3 Prozentpunkten).",
                    "Die SVP bleibt die zweitst\u00e4rkste politische Kraft unter den Auslandschweizer:innen, allerdings mit deutlich niedrigeren Stimmenanteilen als auf nationaler Ebene.",
                    "Im Inland besch\u00e4ftigte die Frage, ob die SVP die 30%-Marke knacken kann. \"Sie ist immer wieder nahe dran, hat es aber noch nie geschafft. Es gibt offenbar ein Plafond f\u00fcr die SVP im In- wie auch im Ausland\", sagt Mousson. Wie fest dies in Stein gemeisselt sei, werde erst die Zukunft zeigen.",
                    "Aber die Auslandschweizer:innen seien eher als liberales bis linkes Wahlpublikum bekannt. \"Das ist nichts Neues, das hat Tradition. Deshalb \u00fcberrascht es mich nicht, dass der Anstieg bei den SVP-Stimmen nicht gr\u00f6sser ausgefallen ist\", so Mousson.",
                    "Auf nationaler Ebene erzielte die Sozialistische Partei hinter der SVP den zweitst\u00e4rksten Zuwachs (1,2 Punkte auf 18% der Stimmen). Im Ausland konnte sie am st\u00e4rksten zulegen (2,8 Punkte, von 17,6% auf 20,4% W\u00e4hleranteil).",
                    "Die wichtigste Ver\u00e4nderung im Wahlverhalten der Auslandschweizer:innen im Jahr 2023 scheint somit ein Transfer der Stimmen, die 2019 an die Gr\u00fcnen gegangen waren, hin zur SP zu sein.",
                    "Zum Einbruch der Gr\u00fcnen bei den Auslandschweizer:innen sagt Mousson: \"Ich glaube nicht, dass die Gr\u00fcnen etwas falsch gemacht haben.\" Die Leseweise sei, dass gr\u00fcne Themen von anderen \u00fcberlagert wurden. \"Generell profitieren in unsicheren Weltlagen rechte Parteien eher. Die Gr\u00fcnen sind wohl Opfer von der Themenkonjunktur geworden\", sch\u00e4tzt Mousson ein. Umgekehrt h\u00e4tten sie vor vier Jahren von der Themenlage profitiert.",
                    "Bei den anderen Parteien bleiben die Werte relativ stabil. Die Mitte\u00a0gewann 0,9 Prozentpunkte hinzu, was in etwa dem landesweiten Zuwachs entspricht (0,8 Prozentpunkte). Die FDP verlor 0,6 Prozentpunkte (gegen\u00fcber 0,7 in der Gesamtschweiz).",
                    "Insgesamt best\u00e4tigt das Wahlverhalten der Diaspora bei den Parlamentswahlen die Tendenz, dass diese W\u00e4hlerschaft linker und gr\u00fcner w\u00e4hlt als die inl\u00e4ndische Bev\u00f6lkerung. Die wichtigsten linken Parteien (SP und Gr\u00fcne) erhielten zusammen fast 39% der Stimmen (gegen\u00fcber 27% in der Schweiz), w\u00e4hrend die gr\u00fcnen Parteien (Gr\u00fcne und Gr\u00fcnliberale) im Ausland zusammen auf 30% kamen (gegen\u00fcber 17% in der Schweiz).",
                    "Die Wahlbeteiligung der Auslandschweizer:innen war wie so oft tief: Sie betrug insgesamt 18,7% und war in fast allen Kantonen mit Ausnahme von Basel-Stadt und St. Gallen r\u00fcckl\u00e4ufig. Im Inland hingegen stieg sie im Vergleich zu 2019 leicht an, von 45,1% auf 46,6%.",
                    "43 Auslandschweizer:innen sind bei den eidgen\u00f6ssischen Wahlen 2023 angetreten. Es ist zwar wenig \u00fcberraschend, dass keine:r der Kandidat:innen gew\u00e4hlt wurde, zwei Auslandschweizer stechen mit ihren Resultaten jedoch heraus.",
                    "Am meisten Stimmen holte im Kanton Bern Pascal Cuttat aus Nairobi. Ganze 12'451 Berner:innen haben f\u00fcr den 61-j\u00e4hrigen SP-Mann gestimmt. Weil Cuttat, der beim Schweizerischen Roten Kreuz arbeitet, auf der Hauptliste der Berner SP-M\u00e4nner-Liste aufgef\u00fchrt war, ist das gute Resultat im Vergleich zu den anderen Auslandschweizer:innen nachvollziehbar. Auf seiner Liste weist Cuttat hingegen das schlechteste Resultat aus. Die SP ist die zweitst\u00e4rkste Partei im Kanton Bern, sie holte 5 Sitze.",

Mit 11'947 Stimmen platzierte er sich auf dem zweiten Ersatzplatz auf der Liste der Gr\u00fcnen.\u00a0Der Gem\u00fcsebauer aus dem franz\u00f6sischen Pougny erhielt alleine aus der Stadt Genf 4271 Stimmen und aus dem Ausland 999.

                "en_content": "The green wave that marked the 2019 parliamentary elections is a thing of the past. At the national level, the green parties had to accept a regular slap. With 9.4% of the votes, the Greens fell by 3.8 percentage points and lost five seats in the National Council. Only the other green party, the Green Liberal Party, slipped even further in the mandates (-6 seats and a decrease in the voter share by 0.6 points to 7.2%).\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland elected its parliament on Sunday 22 October. Here are the results for the National Council and State elections.\nThe Swiss people who live abroad also chose much less for the Greens this year: In all twelve cantons, which provide separate statistics on the Diaspora vote, the Green Party loses 5.4 percentage points of its voter share and falls from the strongest party in 2019 (with 23.8% of the votes) to the third place this year (with 18.4%).\nAlthough the Fifth Switzerland traditionally chooses more climate-friendly than the rest of Switzerland, the Greens therefore see a decline in the votes. This has, according to Martina Mousson, political scientist of\n, just as in Switzerland to do with the current topic.\nThis was fundamentally different in these elections than four years ago. \"Although the climate topic is still one of the main concerns, it was obviously not a matter of choice. It was overlaid by other topics,\" said Mousson \u2013 the Ukraine war, the economic situation, the economic situation, the economic situation, the inflation. \"Not only Switzerland is affected by this,\" says the political scientist.\nUnlike in Germany, however, it is not possible to say that the SVP has triumphed on the part of Swiss foreigners: in the world.\nThe right-wing Conservative Party is the largest political force in the country and this year has also increased most (9 seats and 28.6% of votes, an increase of 3 percentage points).\nThe SVP remains the second strongest political force among the Swiss foreigners: but with significantly lower proportions of votes than at national level.\nIn Germany, the question was whether the SVP can crack the 30% mark. \"She's always close, but never did it. There is apparently a plaid for the SVP in Germany and abroad,\" says Mousson. How tightly this is in stone will only show the future.\nBut the foreign Swiss: they are more known than liberal to left-wing electoral republics. \"This is nothing new, it has tradition. That's why I'm not surprised that the increase in the SVP voices is not more pronounced,\" said Mousson.\nAt national level, the Socialist Party achieved the second largest increase behind the SVP (1.2 points to 18% of the votes). In foreign countries, it was most likely to increase (2.8 points, from 17.6% to 20.4% of voters).\nThe most important change in the electoral behaviour of the Swiss foreigners: in 2023, a transfer of the voices that had gone to the Greens in 2019 seems to be going to the SP.\nMousson says: \"I don't think the Greens have done anything wrong.\" Reading is rather that green topics were overlaid by others. \"As a general rule, right-wing parties benefit in uncertain world situations. The Greens have probably become victims of the theme economy,\" says Mousson. Conversely, they would have benefited from the subject four years ago.\nThe other parties remain relatively stable. The middle was up to 0.9 percentage points, which is about the country-wide increase (0.8 percentage points). The FDP lost 0.6 percentage points (compared to 0.7 in total Switzerland).\nOverall, the electoral behaviour of the Diaspora in the parliamentary elections confirms the tendency that this electorate chooses more left and greener than the domestic population. The main left-wing parties (SP and Greens) together received almost 39% of the votes (compared to 27% in Switzerland), while the green parties (green and green liberals) came together to 30% abroad (compared to 17% in Switzerland).\nThe turnout of the Swiss foreigners was as often deep: it was 18.7% in total and fell in almost all cantons except Basel-Stadt and St. Gallen. In Germany, however, it rose slightly from 45.1% to 46.6% compared to 2019.\n43 Swiss foreigners: within the Federal Elections 2023. Although it is not surprising that no one: the candidate was elected, two Swiss foreigners stand out with their results.\nMost votes were taken in the canton of Bern Pascal Cuttat from Nairobi. Whole 12'451 Berner: Inside have voted for the 61-year-old SP-man. Because Cuttat, who works at the Swiss Red Cross, was listed on the main list of the Bernese SP-M\u00e4nner list, the good result is comprehensible in comparison with the other Swiss abroad. On his list, Cuttat, on the other hand, shows the worst result. The SP is the second strongest party in the canton of Bern.\nIn Geneva, the Green Rudolf Berli (France) achieved a success of respect. With 11'947 votes, he placed himself on the second place on the list of greens. The French Pougny vegetable farmer received 4271 votes from the city of Geneva alone and 999 from abroad. For comparison: In the canton of Geneva, the national councils are elected: in Delphine Klopfenstein Broggini with 15'549 votes and Nicolas Walder, who is also the Swiss Foreign Council, with 15'271 votes.\nFor comparison: The last elected national council from abroad was Tim Guldimann for the SP in the canton of Zurich. In 2015, he achieved a brilliant result and won 102'757 votes. He was not the first foreign Swiss in Parliament at the time, but the first to be elected as a foreign Swiss. Guldimann resigned in 2018. His resignation was based on the fact that it was difficult to \"live in a milieu and make politics in another milieu\".\nIn practice, Swiss foreigners have hardly any chances of being elected, this also confirms Ariane Rustichelli from the Swiss foreign organisation ASO. \"The case of Guldimann was quite extraordinary,\" says Rustichelli.\nThe demand for the Fifth Switzerland to have a direct representation in Parliament is constantly being raised. \"The ASO has a working group that supports this,\" says Rustichelli. However, because there should be a constitutional change, this demand would not have been successful.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nFrom the writer in Berlin to the diplomat in Australia. 43 Swiss foreigners: candid for the National Council.

In the election campaign, she once again put on immigration, with success.\nMigration is the most influential issue when it comes to the choice of a party, just before the rising health insurance premiums and climate change. This shows the post-election analysis carried out by the Sotomo Institute.\nAccording to the survey, the overwhelming majority of the Party's SVP vote (74%) gave its vote on its migration policy.\nIt has a kind of monopoly on the subject, so no other party could convince a majority of its supporters on this issue.\nOn the other hand, the independence and sovereignty of the country, represented by the SVP, were only a decisive argument for 21% of the voters: within the right-conservative party a decisive argument.\nThe Greens were the great losers of the election Sunday and could not create the same hype for climate policy as four years ago. While their electorate was almost entirely motivated by this issue, other parties also benefited from it.\nMore\nDebates\nHow do you assess the results of these elections? Has your place of residence and have you chosen like Switzerland?\nMany people also chose the S &amp; D Party (SP) for their programme to combat climate change. The SP also convinced their electorate on social issues such as health insurance premiums or social security.\nWith its strategy, the SVP also managed to win and mobilise new voters, as the analysis shows after the election. In contrast, the Greens have lost part of their electorate to almost all other parties, with the exception of the liberal FDP. More than half of the losses of the Green Party benefited the SP, but it also lost a little to the SVP, the middle and the green liberals.\nThe follow-up to the parliamentary elections of the 22nd In October 2023, the Sotomo research institute was commissioned by the Swiss Radio and Television Society (SRG, which also includes swissinfo.ch). The data were collected between 21 October and 23 October. 23 207 voters: they participated in the survey, on the one hand on the SRG web portals, on the other hand on the Sotomo website. The error margin is +/- 1.2 percentage points.\nThe Sotomo-Politolog also examined the reasons for a party change. Result: Nearly one third of respondents were dissatisfied with how their previous party has dealt with the rising sickness insurance premiums. This was especially beneficial to the SP, but also to the center.\nOne quarter was not in agreement with the migration policy of their previous party, with more than half of it moving to the SVP.\nThe most common are the debates on gender and wokeism as a trigger for the election of another party, as well as the polarization of political debates. A large part of these people therefore decided to vote for the middle, as the survey shows.\n\"The topic is no longer exclusively reserved for the Greens,\" says the political scientist Sarah B\u00fctikofer of Sotomo.\nThe vote on the climate law adopted by the people in June has shown that all parties recognise that Switzerland must take care of the energy supply and implement the necessary changes.\nIt recalls that the Greens have spoken about the energy transition decades ago, but believes that their position today is more capable. \"So you don't have to choose green anymore if you want someone in Parliament to be involved in this issue,\" explains the political scientist.\nDespite the legal pressure in Parliament, social demands have not disappeared. Priority for voters is their wallet: 66% of voters believe that the newly elected legislative solutions must be found in order to slow down the cost increase in health costs and health insurance premiums.\nThe electoral population seems to trust the right to resolve these social issues. This is not paradoxical in the eyes of Sara B\u00fctikofer.\nIt recalls that the SVP is largely mobilised in lower income populations. \"After the intensification of asylum law, this is the second most important priority of the party,\" she emphasises.\nMore\n\n\n\n\nWhat remains under the line of these elections?

Trade became free and protected in the event of war, taxes were not paid, incoming ships were no longer searched and foreigners could be owners of houses and land. The city \u2014 the only port of the Habsburg Empire \u2014 thus became the door of trade between the East and the West and in a few decades lived an unprecedented development: from every corner of Europe came entrepreneurs, but also artisans, masons, simple people looking for a future. In a few years they appeared as large commercial mushrooms that needed arms, but also ideas.\nThe various foreign communities were formed (armena, Hebrew, Greek, Serbian, German, English). \"From Switzerland came the Griot, Fontana, Escher, Genel, Glanzmann, Bois de Chesne, Rittmeyer, Collioud and many others who in a short time were at the head of important companies and industries, as well as apical roles in the Chamber of Commerce, Banks and Insurance,\" explains the president of the Swiss Club of Trieste\n.\nAt the same time, the city also experienced an urban explosion, necessary to support the constant arrival of inhabitants and the exponential increase of activities. In just 150 years, from mid-700 to late 1800s, Trieste passed from 5\u2019000 to 200\u2019000 residents.\nThe harmonious architecture that characterizes the historic centre also contributed many architects and engineers from Ticino including Pietro Nobile, Giovanni and Domenico Righetti, Giovanni Scalmanini, Giuseppe Bernardi and Giovanni Gallacchi.\n\"In the first years of development of the city,\" explains the art historian\n\u2014 architects and masters had built simple invoices, taking care of the decorations and much of the functionality, reasoning for a class of merchants who wanted to invest in merchant companies and not in forms of representation: were buildings marked by the peaceful rhythms of the voids and the full. Only the main entrance was adorned with the rustic bugnate and on the upper floor appeared a rococo balcony\".\nIn this context the personality and style of Pietro Nobile (1776-1854), born in Campestro, near Capriasca, has arrived in Trieste very young to follow the master father. He studied in Rome thanks to a scholarship from the Municipality of Trieste, led the archaeological excavations in the Roman area of the city, designed the aqueduct and the library.

But to assert that the entire border is guarded and that no clandestine will enter more would be pure rhetoric. Many Swiss borders are located in very important economic regions, such as the Basel or Ticino, where many vehicles enter every day. The additional controls we have decided are sufficient, they are the right measure to take in the face of the current situation.\"\nWith these statements, made on Thursday at the edge of the EU's internal ministers meeting in Strasbourg, the Federal Councillor Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, Head of the Customs and Security Office of the Frontiers (UDSC), has so for now excluded following what has been done in recent days since, among others, Germany and Italy.\nOn Monday, in the face of the growth of arrivals and the crisis in the Middle East, the German Government notified Brussels that it wanted to introduce fixed controls at frontiers with Switzerland, Poland and the Czech Republic, thereby temporarily suspending the Schengen Treaty. Yesterday, Wednesday, Italy took the same step, announcing that it wanted to restore border controls between Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Slovenia.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nBerlin has notified Brussels that it intends to introduce fixed border controls with Switzerland, Czech Republic and Switzerland.\nElisabeth Baume-Schneider said he understood the reaction of the German authorities, in particular in the light of the \"terrible accident\". The Federal Councilor alluded to what happened a week ago in Bavaria, where seven people died following an accident that had involved a vehicle of traffickers of migrants, who was supposedly escaping police control. In the van, homologated for up to nine people, there were more than 20 refugees and refugees.\nThe announcement of the head of the Federal Department of Justice and Police is already making a debate.\nThe migration issue was one of the main themes of the campaign in view of the federal elections scheduled this weekend. The central democratic Union (UDC, right-wing conservative) once again has overtaken its theme of predilection, which together with the increase in health insurance premiums and pensions is this year\n. But other parties have not been left alone, and the Socialist Minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider has often found himself at the centre of criticism for his policy, which, above all on the right, many think too laxist.\nFor example, last June the Federal Councilor was blamed by some members of the Council of States for having proved too passive towards Rome. Since December 2022 Italy has no longer received asylum seekers who, according to the Dublin agreement, would fall within its sphere of competence.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe stall on the admission of refugee people will not end so soon, says the Swiss police and justice minister Elisabeth.. .\nThe decision, just less than a month ago, of the Customs Office and the security of the borders to send additional staff from German Switzerland to the border with Italy to cope with the expected increase of the arrivals of refugee people did not calm the waters.\nIn recent months, the number of illegally entering Switzerland has increased, especially south of the Alps. Only in September were 7'120 illegal stays, 1'300 more than in August.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe shift of migration routes within the Balkans has favoured the increase of refugees and migrants entering illegally in Switzerland.\nAnd in the light of the decision taken Monday by Germany, the UDC is no longer alone to call for systematic checks at frontiers. \" Imagine what would happen if Germany stopped more migrants at the border. They would stay in Switzerland,\" he said.\n\n. The Radical Liberal National Council, President of the Commission for Foreign Policy, called on the Federal Government to prepare for the reintroduction of customs checks.\nThe outgoing National Council of the Centre\nHe speaks for his part of \"myopia\" by the socialist ministra and a choice dictated by a \"totally ideological\" approach.\n\"In Lampedusa there is a number of record bars, there are more people moving in Europe. It should not be emphasized, but the least that can be done is to strengthen the controls\", says to tvsvizzera.it Romano.\nAs reiterated by Elisabeth Baume-Schneider and other exponents from his political field, reintroducing systematic checks at frontiers would however cause many inconvenience. A first taste took place on Tuesday in certain valleys of Basel and in Kreuzlingen, in the Canton of Turkey, with columns of cars that formed following the introduction of the new measure by Germany.\nThe Helvetic Government has repeatedly reiterated that carrying out generalized controls of people at frontiers \"is not realistic\". Such control did not exist even before Switzerland joined the Schengen area. \"Every day, just 3% of the approximately 700,000 people who on average crossed the border were subjected to in-depth checks,\" the Federal Council noted in 2015 in response to\nof the Ticinese League MP Lorenzo Quadri, who during the migration crisis had asked for a suspension of the Schengen agreements.\nThe figure of 700,000 people \u2013 which referred to the previous period in 2008, when Switzerland entered the Schengen area \u2013 is in the meantime rising. Last\navailable from the Federal Statistical Office refer to 2021 and are not particularly representative, since it was in the pandemic period and the movements were limited. The previous data of 2015 were more significant: in that year they entered on average in Switzerland 1,06 million people, almost 200,000 from Italy.\n\"It's not about searching every car in the entrance,\" Marco Romano says, but about doing a targeted inspection, for example on Flixbus and trains, used \"from 95% of migrants\" who enter Switzerland.\nOr \u2013 continues the Ticino parliamentarian \u2013 \"we can make the ostriches\", pretending nothing because the majority of people entering Switzerland from the south border just wants to reach Germany or other countries of northern Europe. A position which, after the decision of Berlin four days ago, is likely to revert to Switzerland.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nWe asked cantons when they sent voting documents to citizens and citizens abroad. Who shone and who failed?\nArticles mentioned",

                "en_content": "Are you used to spectacular rebounds in your country? To parties that from one election to another pass from 5 to 30% or inversely? If you think this kind of overturning is the pepper of democracy, you can safely ignore the Swiss elections.\nIn the Confederation, when electoral polls are published, they are disregarded for days on the important decline of the Greens or on the advance of the Central Democratic Union. Decline and advanced? The first would lose 2.5% of suffrage compared to 2019, while the second party would progress by 1%, according to the last survey of March. All with an error margin of 1.2%. .\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nMajor winners of the 2019 federal elections, ecologists and ecologists are losing some ground.\nYes, because if there is an element that distinguishes the Swiss Parliament is its extraordinary stability. Not that its composition has remained identical in the last 175 years. Anything else. In the last twenty years, for example, the Central Democratic Union has progressed strongly, almost triple its electoral force between 1991 and 2015. Two new forces also appeared, the Greens and the Liberal Green Party, which compared to more or less ephemeral formations of Swiss political history do not seem destined to dissolve so soon.\nBut compared to other Western democracies, in the Confederation the shift of balances is more tectonic than telluric, as can be seen in this chart, which sums up the strength of the parties in the House of People (National Council), elected since 1919 with the proportional system.\nThe Federal Assembly \u2013 this is the official name of the Swiss Parliament \u2013 consists of two Chambers: the Council of States, representing the cantons and counting 46 members, and the National Council, an expression of the people with 200 members.\nThis bicameral system established in 1848 after the birth of the federal state is based mainly on the American model. The two bodies have the same skills and every decision needs the advance of the two Chambers.\nThe number of representatives in the Council of States has always remained the same: two 'senatories' or 'separators' for Canton and one for each of the six\n. In other words, 44 members until 1978 and 46 since 1979, the year of the entry of the Canton Jura into the Confederation.\nThe National Council has undergone several amendments. In 1848 it had 111 members. Each Member (the male is obliged, since the first women were elected in Parliament in 1971, after the introduction of the female suffrage) represented about 20,000 (including foreign people). Population growth has resulted in a progressive increase in the workforce. Since 1962, it has been set at 200. Today each member of the National Council represents about 40,000 inhabitants.\nEach canton has a number of national advisers proportional to its population. Zurich, for example, is entitled to 35 seats. Internal hanger and other small cantons to one. It happens relatively often that a canton gains or loses a seat depending on its demographic development.\nAnother particular feature of Switzerland (and related to federalism) is that the Council of States, being an expression of the cantons, is elected according to cantonal law. In theory, therefore, a canton may decide to elect its representatives as and when it best believes. In fact, however, the elections are held simultaneously with those of the National Council, except for Appenzell Interno, who appoints the person who represents it in April before the federal elections.\nIn Neuch\u00e2tel and Jura, representatives or representatives in the Council of States may also be elected by those who do not have a Swiss passport. These cantons are in fact the only ones in Switzerland to grant the right to vote at the cantonal level to foreign people.\nThe elections for the Council of States take place practically everywhere with the majority system. Only the cantons of Neuch\u00e2tel and Jura \u2013 both of them... \u2013 apply the proportional system.\nThe National Council has been elected since 1919 with the proportional system. The constituencies are the cantons.\nThis coexistence of a majority system and a proportional system has a marginal influence on the weight of parties in Parliament. In the National Council the representation is determined by the percentage of votes obtained from each party. Incidentally, it is also this percentage which is generally used to analyze the outcome of an election and progression or backwardness of such or such other political field.\nThe majority system applied for elections in the Council of States does not necessarily favour the stronger numerical party at national level. Other considerations prevail: the rooting of a party in the canton, ability to create alliances to present a single candidate, vocation to the consent of the latter... It is no coincidence that the Council of States is still dominated by two historical parties, but in the last elections they conquered just over 26% of the suffrage. The Alliance of the Centre and the Radical Liberal Party can count on 25 representatives (13 the first, 12 the second) out of 46. The first Swiss party, the Central Democratic Union, with a percentage of votes of 25.6%, has just got six seats.\nContrary to what happens in other States, for example in the United States where the President can veto certain rules, the Swiss Parliament is immune to the other two powers. His decisions cannot be taken by the Government. Their constitutionality cannot even be questioned by the Federal Court, the highest Swiss judicial instance.\nOn the other hand, there is no motion of censorship in Switzerland and the Federal Assembly cannot thus destitute the Government, nor can it remove a federal adviser during its mandate, except in exceptional cases as a serious disease.\nThe only possibility that Parliament has to manifest its dissatisfaction with a member of the executive is the election of the government, which takes place every four years in December following the federal elections. The system of concordance that characterizes the Swiss political system makes this kind of dispute extremely rare. From 1848 until today only four federal advisers and councillors were not confirmed by Parliament. The last one was the UDC exponent Christoph Blocher in 2007.\nIn Switzerland there is not even antagonism between majority and opposition. In most of the dossiers, the Government and Parliament must try to find a compromise to be supported by a majority, which may vary from time to time since there is no coalition agreement between political forces. At the same time, members of the legislature of the Government Parties are not obliged to support the decisions of the Federal Council.\nAll this makes Switzerland not aware of government crisis and early elections. What is about to end is the 51st legislature since 1848.\nIf his decisions are law, the Swiss Parliament always thinks of a heavy sword of Damocle, which is the name of an optional referendum. By collecting 50,000 signatures within 100 days of the official publication of the act, anyone can oppose the decisions of the legislature, asking that the law or federal decree be subjected to the judgment of the electorate.\nFrom the founding of the federal state in 1848 until the introduction of the proportional system in 1917, the Federal Assembly was dominated by the Democratic Radical Party (which became the Radical Liberal Party in 2009), with the sole opposition of the Conservative Catholics (the future Democratic People's Party).\nThe introduction of the proportional system for the election of the National Council in 1919 changed the charts at the table, allowing parties that until then had to settle crumbs to begin to really weigh on national politics. In that year, for example, the Socialist Party passed from 22 to 41 representatives. In the same elections, the Party of Peasants, Craftsmen and Independents joined forces. Turned into the Central Democratic Union in 1971, today this training is the party of a relative majority in the Swiss Parliament.\nAlthough with ups and downs, these four parties made the beautiful and bad weather throughout the 20th century in Switzerland. Since the end of the millennium, however, with increasing environmental sensitivity, the Green Party first and the Liberal Green Party then re-echoed the cards, so much so that in the last federal elections they conquered a total of a fifth of the seats of the Federal Assembly.\nIn the course of these 175 years of parliamentary history, there were no lack of course smaller parties, sometimes ephemeral or rooted only in certain cantons, which lasted perhaps the space of some legislature, but which sometimes managed to dictate time on certain issues. One can think, for example, of\nand his leader James Schwarzenbach. This extreme right-wing party, which reached a maximum of five seats, was the origin of the \"unforestation\" initiatives of the 1970s.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\n50 years ago the Swiss spoke about the removal from the country of hundreds of thousands of Italian workers.\nLess ephemeral instead\n, which could count on representatives in the National Council \u2013 and even in the Council of States \u2013 from 1935 to 1999. The movement created by the founder of the group Migros Gottlieb Duttweiler in 1935, with the aim of fighting against the overflow of lobby in Parliament, managed at the end of the 1970s to touch even 10% of votes and then slowly dissolve until dissolved in 1999.\nYou can mention the\n, which in Switzerland has never managed to break, at least at national level, and was banned in 1940 and then replaced in 1944 by\n. O\n, right-wing training contrary to state rules in economic and environmental protection, born in 1985 and later renamed the Freedom Party.\nIf you have no connection with the Confederation, most likely the term \"militia\" will evoke in you some war image. Although it is derived from the military sphere, \"the expression system of militia designates an organizational principle diffused in Swiss public life, which is based on the republican idea according to which every suitable citizen must assume, as an honorific or accessory, charges and public tasks,\" explains the\n.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nOne of the cornerstones of Swiss participatory democracy is the militia system. What lies behind this name that evokes fighters?\nIn the Swiss political and institutional context, the militia system is intended as the opposite of professionalism. The Swiss Parliament is in fact composed of politicians and politicians who, in addition to their parliamentary activities, carry out work. Or rather, this was the ideal vision that took until a few decades ago.\nToday the federal parliamentary work has become more complex and absorbs the equivalent of a 50% activity. Practically a person elected on three is a full-time politician, according to a\nof 2019 of the University of Lausanne.\nIn the late 1960s, members of the Federal Assembly did not receive any wages, but only tokens of presence and travel allowances, unlike their Western counterparts. Today, however, they receive an annual pay of 26,000 francs, a diary of 440 francs per day of sitting, an allowance of 33,000 francs for staff and material costs and other compensation for travel, meals and overnight stays.\nBetween 2011 and 2015, the median gross income was 68,400 francs for members of the National Council and 79,500 for those of the Council of States (who usually participate in a greater number of commissioning sessions and delegations), according to one of the\nUniversity of Geneva.\nHowever, this direct income should be added to flat payments which are not spent, in particular the unused part of allowances for staff costs. In other words, a member of the Federal Assembly can earn about CHF 100,000 per year. A figure higher than the average national wage, which is just over 80'000 francs.\nIf compared to the salaries of many of their European counterparts, the Swiss MPs are definitely underpaid. In Italy, for example, where the cost of living is much lower than in Switzerland and where the average income is just over 30'000 euros, the members of the Chamber and Senate monthly perceive approximately 14'000 euros. In Brussels, however, Euro MPs have a monthly salary of 9'400 euro gross, without counting the various benefits.\nI mean, being a politician in Switzerland is certainly not the job that pays more.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\n\u00abWe have one of the least expensive parliaments in the world\u00bb: in Switzerland is a recurring phrase. But the elvetic elect as if they pass it over to their...\nAny Swiss citizen, man or woman, aged 18, resident or not in the Confederation, may be elected in Parliament. The majority and parliamentarians belong to a political party, but it is not obligatory. You can be elected without being members of a party. Only those people who are interdept by mental infirmity or weakness are excluded.\nIn the current legislation, the National Council consists of 41.5% of women, while the Council of States continues to remain a male fief. Only one in four is a woman.\nIn the House of People the average age is 51, while in the House of Cantons 57 years. This figure has remained substantially stable since the early 20th century, although in the last 30 years the average age in the National Council has declined slightly.\n60% of elected persons have an academic qualification. However, the percentage varies strongly from one party to another. If the proportion between the liberal Greens is almost 90%, between the UDC files drops to 33%, according to a\nof the University of Lausanne on the socio-professional profile of Members of Parliament.\nAs regards the professions, the profile of members of the Swiss Parliament as often happens is not the exact mirror of society. In addition to policy professionals, it stands out\u2013 although it is not a surprise - the high proportion of business managers, lawyers, farmers or teachers.\nFor example, lawyers account for approximately 0.3% of the working population, while in Parliament they occupy more than a tenth of seats. The same applies to farmers: are slightly more than 2% of the active population, but their weight in the legislative system is definitely larger.\nOther developments\n\nA milestone in vacilla democracy.

The results were published in the last issue of the magazine\n.\n\"The countries or political actors involved in a conflict are encouraged to hide or manipulate these numbers, while third parties may not have access to reliable information,\" he is remembered in the study.\nApplied to the first year of the Russian aggression war in Ukraine, the model estimates that about 76,700 Russian military and about 17,200 Ukrainians were killed. For each Russian military killed Russian sources reported only 0.3 casualties, he notes the study. On the contrary, for every Ukrainian military killed, Russian sources reported 4.3 victims.\nAccording to statistics, Ukrainian sources have overestimated the deaths of the counterpart, reporting almost twice as many victims as the estimate of the new model. The authors did not find any evidence of systematic partiality in the Ukrainian reports on the deaths of Ukrainian soldiers.\nFor their model, researchers have used publicly accessible data. In total, 4'609 reports of civilian casualties and soldiers fell on social networks, news and various government sources. The figures of daily and cumulated victims were given in the various reports. \"Sometimes they don't even coincide in the same media,\" Stoehr explained, and \"there is even less correspondence between the different sources.\"\nThe model interpolates the figures of losses from different sources and, on the basis of various transparent hypotheses, calculates an average value. The researchers were inspired by the so-called \"\n\" - a well-known statistical problem developed by the Allies during World War II to estimate the number of German panzers.\nThe model can also be used in other scenarios where different parts have a natural interest in falsifying the figures and where the accumulated and absolute values are not necessarily consistent. For example, you could use it to study data on counters in a pandemic, the scientist explained.\nYou probably never know exactly how much the deaths of the conflict were in Ukraine, Stoehr said.

This aspect must be more exploited, especially with regard to training, exercises and supplies.\nThe objectives and strategy in this sense were defined by the army in the new report \"Reinforcement of the ability to defend - Objectives and strategy for strengthening\".\nAfter the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, the National Council and the Council of States decided, in 2022, to gradually increase the expenditure for the army from 2023, so that at the latest by 2030 at least 1% of the gross domestic product.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nThe new increase in health insurance premiums will further test the family budgets, but the system is complex to reform.\nArticles mentioned",

In a brief statement, Gallant confirmed that some \"fight jet pools are currently hitting a series of Hamas targets\" in the territory.\n\"We're at war, it's not a military operation. This morning, Hamas surprised a murderous attack against the State of Israel and its citizens,\" said Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu. He made known that he had summoned the leaders of security, giving them instructions to free first of all \"villages from terrorists who have infiltrated\", before adding that he had \"ordered to call the reservists in order to fight with a force and a capacity that the enemy has not yet known. We're at war and we'll win it.\" According to internal sources to the Israeli police, it would be 200-300 terrorists who managed to penetrate the country.\nOn Saturday, the deputy head of Hamas, Saleh al-Arouri was also expressed. The group, told Al Jazeera, is engaged in a battle \"for freedom\". \"This is not a deadly operation and escape, we started a battle in the field. We expect the fighting to continue and the battle front expands. We have a primary goal: our freedom and freedom of our holy places. We will continue to fight until we are rewarded with victory, freedom and independence,\" he added. The group is ready for the worst scenario, continued al-Arouri: \"All scenarios are now possible and we are ready for an invasion of Israeli land,\" he said, saying that Israel had planned to launch an attack on the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.\nThe TG edition dedicated in its almost totality to the developments of what is expected to be the beginning of a long period of fighting:\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nNever as at this time the accession of Switzerland to the EU seems so unlikely. Why? Travelling with a group of Swiss fans of the EU.\nArticles mentioned",

The people taken hostage by Hamas \"must be immediately released\", said Cassis. According to the head of Swiss diplomacy, what is happening in Israel and Palestine \"has not seen for decades.\"\nWith regard to the geopolitical situation, Cassis called on the parties to respect international humanitarian law, to protect the civilian population and to prudence, inviting the contenders not to provoke an escalation of the conflict that could spread throughout the region. \"A regional conflict in the Middle East,\" said Cassis, \"would have a direct impact on our country.\"\nThe Swiss embassy in Tel Aviv remained open this weekend, despite the chaos in which Israel has been landing for three days. Also operating the representative office in Ramallah, in the West Bank. In the region it would be 28'000 people with a red-crusted passport, but according to the DFAE so far only 230 people have contacted the Department to ask for information on the situation.\nIt was people currently on the spot, others who were planning a trip to Israel and worried relatives. Berne is not organising departures from Israel, says the FAE, but is clarifying whether citizens and citizens of the Confederation can take advantage of trips set up by other states. Tomorrow, Tuesday, a SWISS flight will bring 219 people back to Switzerland.\nThe Swiss Government Security Council met yesterday, Sunday, in closed-door consultations to discuss the situation in the Middle East. For the Confederation, the priority is now to establish a ceasefire and avoid a regional escalation of the conflict and this was the content of an appeal to the parties involved and to all States which can exert an influence on the crisis. Switzerland also supports the urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Monday to discuss escalation in the Middle East. He writes on X (ex Twitter) the head of DFAE communication Nicolas Bideau, according to which it is necessary to face as quickly as possible the situation.\nMeanwhile, some parties including the Swiss-Israel parliamentary group have asked the government to reconsider the country's traditional caution and call Hamas \"terrorist organization\". The Socialist MP Fabian Molina asked not to stop humanitarian support for the Palestinian people. \"Hamas with his attack has cynically transformed the Palestinian population into slaughtered meat,\" Molina said today, who is a member of the Swiss-Palestina Parliamentary Friendship Group, to the Keystone-ATS agency. The opposite position was expressed in the same hours by the Central Union (UDC, the right sovereign), which asked for a stop to aid.\nThe current crisis will be discussed at the Federal Council meeting on Wednesday. In today's meeting with the press, Cassis confirmed that on the agenda there is the question of how to define Hamas. Switzerland does not have the means to define \"terrorist\" organizations, but this does not mean, it added the \"minister\" of foreign countries, that no ad hoc measures can be taken.\nAbout Swiss support for the Palestinian population, Cassis noted that Switzerland finances on-site 30 non-governmental organizations dealing with human rights or education. At the moment Bern does not intend to suspend aid, nor support for UNRWA, the United Nations organization that deals with aid to Palestinian refugees.\nWith the account of the victims who continue to rise from both sides involved in the conflict, the announcement of the Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant arrived on Monday of the suspension of water, electricity and gas in the Gaza Strip. The initiative is likely to trigger a humanitarian emergency of proportions never seen even in a territory in which, according to international relief organizations, at least two thirds of the population now depend to survive humanitarian aid. On Monday the United Nations Humanitarian Affairs Coordination Office (OCHA) announced that it would be 137,000 people displaced in Gaza.\nOther developments\n\n\n\n\nOn October 15 the Polish electorate is called to the urns.

The Gaza Ministry of Health announced that 1'417 Palestinians, including 326 children, were killed. 6,268 wounded people. The Israeli government said that on the other side of the border 1'300 people died, without specifying how many of them were children or adolescents, 3'700 wounds.\nFrom Geneva, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed great concern about the consequences of the blockade decreed by Tel Aviv, by virtue of which they can no longer enter the Palestinian Territories food, water and gas, with the consequent interruption of the electricity.\nA block that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, called \"illegal in the light of international conventions\". Guterres asks Israel to \"allow the entry into Gaza of essential goods. We need fast and barrier-free humanitarian access.\"\nMeanwhile, a truck sent by the Egyptian government with medical material and first-need goods marched back, after Israel communicated that it would open fire on the convoy. The Israeli Government has reiterated that the blockade will be interrupted only to the liberation of persons kidnapped and held hostage by Hamas. It would be 150, but there is no exact number because of the still imprecisated amount of missing.\nIn Gaza, a total of 339,000 people displaced, about 220,000 people are sheltered in 92 UNRWA facilities. The agency announced yesterday, Wednesday, that eleven people of his staff died following Israeli air strikes, and that 18 UNRWA schools currently turned into shelters were damaged by bombing.\nAlso from Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed that five people who worked for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) died in Gaza. The ICRC urged \"both the parties involved in reducing the suffering of civilians\".\nThe organization is in contact with Israel and Hamas on the question of persons held hostage. The regional director of the Committee for the Near and the Middle East, Fabrizio Carboni, said that \"as a neutral intermediary, we are ready to make humanitarian visits, to facilitate the communication between the hostages and the members of their families and to facilitate their release\". Taking hostages is prohibited by international humanitarian law and any person held must be released immediately, Carboni recalled.\nAlso the CRIC asks to stop the block of lifesaving goods: \"Without electricity, hospitals risk becoming obitoes,\" said Carboni. The UN press office confirmed yesterday, Wednesday, that the 13 health facilities in Gaza are working at the moment only partially, because of the lack of medical material and electricity. According to the BBC, the main hospital in Gaza City would only have four days of backup fuel for its generators. Without electricity for pumps, in addition, in some roads they would be accumulating crude slurry.\nIn the meantime, the international media struggle to understand what is true in the news, circulated on several newspapers also in Switzerland, that 40 children would have been killed, and some even beheaded, during the bloody break of Hamas in the kibbutz of Kfar Aza, a settlement a few kilometers from the Gaza Strip. The news was spread by Israeli journalist Nicole Zedeck, who, however, reversed in the face of the inspiring questions of colleagues and colleagues, who from all over the planet tried to verify the news. The journalist wrote about X (ex Twitter): \"some soldiers told me to believe that 40 children were killed, but the exact number of victims is not yet clear.\"\nThe Israeli military spokesman told the Turkish press agency Anadolu on Tuesday, which has a cooperation agreement with the Italian Ansa,\n. The journalist Samuel Forey of\nparticipated in a \"guided visit\" organized by the Israeli army in the kibbutz and said that the Israeli army would not mention the episode during the tour, to which journalists from various countries participated.
